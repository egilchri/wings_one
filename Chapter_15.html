<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Milly and Kate sit together. While they talk, Kate repeatedly gets up and walks the length of the room. Kate speaks about English society, Aunt Maud, and Lord Mark.</p><p>In their conversation, Kate says Aunt Maud is using her as a bargaining chip. Milly insists she is not an obstacle for Kate regarding Lord Mark. Kate advises Milly to leave their social circle. Milly asks why she says such things. Kate replies, "Because you're a dove," then embraces and kisses her.</p><p>They hear their companions returning. Mrs. Lowder and Mrs. Stringham enter the room. Kate talks with Mrs. Stringham. Mrs. Lowder asks Milly how the evening went, and Milly replies, "I don't think, dear lady, he's here." Mrs. Lowder calls her an "exquisite thing." The visitors then leave.</p><p>The next morning, Milly tells Mrs. Stringham that a doctor, Sir Luke Strett, has an appointment to see her at eleven, but that she will be going out. Milly instructs Mrs. Stringham to tell Sir Luke that Milly is home, and then to meet with him in her place. Milly then says she is going to the National Gallery.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale** is presented as a passive but highly perceptive observer. She feels herself to be in a "current determined... by others," surrendering to being "dealt with." While physically still, her mind is active, analyzing the performances of those around her. An immediate shift occurs when Kate calls her a "dove." Milly instantly seizes this as a "revealed truth," an identity that gives her a new framework for how to act. This new self-perception prompts a change in her situation: she moves from passively receiving plans to actively, if deceptively, creating one by arranging for Mrs. Stringham to meet Sir Luke Strett in her place.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy** is presented as an active and theatrical performer. She is restless, "charming," and in "extraordinary 'form,'" moving and talking to dominate the scene. She projects a hard, cynical frankness, openly deconstructing her aunt, English society, and her own "commercial" position. Her situation shifts abruptly in response to Milly's simple, emotional question. She pivots from a pacing, almost predatory ("panther") cynicism to a ceremonial tenderness, bestowing the "dove" identity upon Milly with a kiss, thus changing the dynamic between them from a lecture to an anointing.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)** is presented as a powerful social strategist whose influence is felt even when she is absent. Kate describes her as a manipulator who uses her niece as a commodity. When she appears, her purpose is to regain control of the situation ("catch hold... of the loose end"). Her immediate situation shifts when Milly directly counters her unspoken plan; Mrs. Lowder's response is a look of "deep criticism" followed by effusive, tactical praise ("Oh, you exquisite thing!"), showing her ability to adapt instantly to a setback.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Stringham (Susie)** is presented as an imaginative and loyal companion. Her role is supportive, and she is easily enrolled in Milly’s plans. Upon hearing Milly’s new arrangement for the doctor, her initial shock is quickly "engulfed" by an "extravagance of assent," immediately accepting her assigned part in the "Byzantine" scheme.</li></ul>

It was doubtless because this queer form of directness
had in itself, for the hour, seemed so sufficient
that Milly was afterwards aware of having really,
all the while—during the strange, indescribable session
before the return of their companions—done
nothing to intensify it. If she was most aware only
afterwards, under the long, discurtained ordeal of
the morrow's dawn, that was because she had really,
till their evening's end came, ceased, after a little,
to miss anything from their ostensible comfort.
What was behind showed but in gleams and
glimpses; what was in front never at all confessed
to not holding the stage. Three minutes had not
passed before Milly quite knew she should have done
nothing Aunt Maud had just asked her. She knew
it moreover by much the same light that had acted
for her with that lady and with Sir Luke Strett. It
pressed upon her then and there that she was still in
a current determined, through her indifference, timidity,
bravery, generosity—she scarce could say
which—by others; that not she but the current
acted, and that somebody else, always, was the
keeper of the lock or the dam. Kate for example
had but to open the flood-gate: the current moved
in its mass—the current, as it had been, of her doing
as Kate wanted. What, somehow, in the most
extraordinary way in the world, <i>had</i> Kate wanted
but to be, of a sudden, more interesting than she had
ever been? Milly, for their evening then, quite held
her breath with the appreciation of it. If she hadn't
been sure her companion would have had nothing,
from her moments with Mrs. Lowder, to go by, she
would almost have seen the admirable creature "cutting in"
to anticipate a danger. This fantasy indeed,
while they sat together, dropped after a little;
even if only because other fantasies multiplied and
clustered, making fairly, for our young woman, the
buoyant medium in which her friend talked and
moved. They sat together, I say, but Kate moved
as much as she talked; she figured there, restless and
charming, just perhaps a shade perfunctory, repeatedly
quitting her place, taking slowly, to and fro, in
the trailing folds of her light dress, the length of the
room, and almost avowedly performing for the
pleasure of her hostess.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was probably because this unusual, direct way of speaking seemed perfectly adequate at the time. Milly realized later, after the strange, indescribable meeting before the others returned, that she hadn't done anything to enhance it. She only became truly aware of this the next morning, as the long, drawn-out day began, because she had stopped missing anything from their outward comfort by the end of the evening. What lay beneath the surface was only hinted at; what was on the surface never admitted to not being the main focus. Three minutes hadn't gone by before Milly knew she should have done something else, something Aunt Maud had just asked of her. She knew this for the same reason she'd known it with Aunt Maud and with Sir Luke Strett. It struck her then that she was still caught in a force determined by others—through her indifference, her shyness, her courage, her generosity, she couldn't say which. It wasn't she who was acting, but the force itself, and someone else was always in control. Kate, for example, only had to open the floodgates, and the force—the force of her own doing, because Kate wanted it—would move. What, in the most extraordinary way, had Kate wanted, other than to suddenly become more interesting than she'd ever been? Milly, for that evening, was absolutely captivated by this idea. If she hadn't been sure her companion had nothing to go on from her time with Mrs. Lowder, she would have almost thought the admirable creature was "stepping in" to prevent a danger. This fantasy faded after a bit while they sat together, perhaps because other fantasies took over, creating a buoyant atmosphere for our young woman as her friend talked and moved. They sat together, I repeat, but Kate moved as much as she talked; she was there, restless and charming, perhaps a little superficial, constantly leaving her seat, pacing the length of the room slowly back and forth in the folds of her light dress, almost as if she were performing for her hostess's amusement.</i></p></div>

<p>
Mrs. Lowder had said to Milly at Matcham that
she and her niece, as allies, could practically conquer
the world; but though it was a speech about which
there had even then been a vague, grand glamour,
the girl read into it at present more of an approach
to a meaning. Kate, for that matter, by herself,
could conquer anything, and <i>she,</i> Milly Theale, was
probably concerned with the "world" only as the
small scrap of it that most impinged on her and that
was therefore first to be dealt with. On this basis
of being dealt with she would doubtless herself do
her share of the conquering: she would have something
to supply, Kate something to take—each of
them thus, to that tune, something for squaring with
Aunt Maud's ideal. This in short was what it came
to now—that the occasion, in the quiet late lamplight,
had the quality of a rough rehearsal of the possible
big drama. Milly knew herself dealt with—handsomely,
completely: she surrendered to the
knowledge, for so it was, she felt, that she supplied
her helpful force. And what Kate had to take Kate
took as freely and, to all appearance, as gratefully;
accepting afresh, with each of her long, slow walks,
the relation between them so established and consecrating
her companion's surrender simply by the interest
she gave it. The interest to Milly herself we
naturally mean; the interest to Kate Milly felt as
probably inferior. It easily and largely came for
their present talk, for the quick flight of the hour
before the breach of the spell—it all came, when considered,
from the circumstance, not in the least abnormal,
that the handsome girl was in extraordinary
"form." Milly remembered her having said that
she was at her best late at night; remembered it by
its having, with its fine assurance, made her wonder
when <i>she</i> was at her best and how happy people must
be who had such a fixed time. She had no time at
all; she was never at her best—unless indeed it were
exactly, as now, in listening, watching, admiring,
collapsing. If Kate moreover, quite mercilessly,
had never been so good, the beauty and the marvel
of it was that she had never really been so frank;
being a person of such a calibre, as Milly would have
said, that, even while "dealing" with you and thereby,
as it were, picking her steps, she could let herself
go, could, in irony, in confidence, in extravagance,
tell you things she had never told before. That was
the impression—that she was telling things, and
quite conceivably for her own relief as well; almost
as if the errors of vision, the mistakes of proportion,
the residuary innocence of spirit still to be remedied
on the part of her auditor had their moments of proving
too much for her nerves. She went at them just
now, these sources of irritation, with an amused
energy that it would have been open to Milly to regard
as cynical and that was nevertheless called for—as
to this the other was distinct—by the way that
in certain connections the American mind broke
down. It seemed at least—the American mind as
sitting there thrilled and dazzled in Milly—not to
understand English society without a separate confrontation
with <i>all</i> the cases. It couldn't proceed
by—there was some technical term she lacked until
Milly suggested both analogy and induction, and
then, differently, instinct, none of which were right:
it had to be led up and introduced to each aspect of
the monster, enabled to walk all round it, whether for
the consequent exaggerated ecstasy or for the still
more as appeared to this critic disproportionate
shock. It might, the monster, Kate conceded, loom
large for those born amid forms less developed and
therefore no doubt less amusing; it might on some
sides be a strange and dreadful monster, calculated
to devour the unwary, to abase the proud, to scandalize
the good; but if one had to live with it one must,
not to be for ever sitting up, learn how: which was
virtually in short to-night what the handsome girl
showed herself as teaching.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Mrs. Lowder had told Milly at Matcham that she and her niece, working together, could practically rule the world. While that statement had a vague, romantic appeal back then, Milly now understood it more clearly. Kate, on her own, could probably achieve anything. Milly, on the other hand, was probably only concerned with the part of the world that directly affected her, the part she needed to deal with first. Based on this understanding, she figured she'd contribute her share to their "conquest." She would provide something, and Kate would take something – both of them fulfilling Aunt Maud's expectations.</i></p><p><i>Essentially, in the quiet lamplight, it felt like a practice run for a major event. Milly felt she was being "dealt with" graciously and completely. She accepted it because she knew she was contributing her positive energy. And Kate took what Milly offered just as freely and gratefully, renewing the bond between them with each of their long, slow walks, validating her companion's contribution simply by showing interest in it. Of course, Milly assumed the interest was mainly for herself; Kate's interest was probably secondary.</i></p><p><i>All this talk, this quick hour before they stopped, stemmed from the fact that the beautiful Kate was in top form. Milly remembered Kate saying she was best late at night, and how that statement had made her wonder when *she* was at her best, and how lucky people were to have a consistent time like that. She had no consistent time; she was never at her best – unless, of course, she was listening, watching, admiring, and yielding, like now.</i></p><p><i>Moreover, if Kate had never been so impressive, the amazing thing was that she had never been so open. Kate, being the type of person she was, could open up, even while guiding and advising Milly. She could be ironic, confidential, and expressive, and tell things she never told before. That was the feeling: that she was finally revealing things, maybe for her own benefit as well. It was as if Milly's errors in perception and understanding, and her remaining naivety, were occasionally too much for Kate to handle.</i></p><p><i>Kate addressed those irritations with an amused energy that Milly might have found cynical, but that was necessary, as the other woman saw it, because of the way the American mind processed things in certain social situations. It seemed to Kate – who was observing an enthralled and amazed Milly – that the American mind couldn't grasp English society without analyzing every single case. It couldn't use a certain method – Milly didn’t know the exact term, until she suggested analogy and induction, and then instinct, none of which were quite right. Instead, the American mind had to be guided and introduced to each aspect of the "monster" (English society), allowed to explore it thoroughly, whether for extreme delight or, as Kate saw it, for excessive shock.</i></p><p><i>This "monster," Kate admitted, might seem huge to those who were used to less complex forms of society, and therefore, undoubtedly, less entertaining. It might be a strange and terrifying monster, designed to hurt the naive, humble the proud, and offend the virtuous. But if you had to deal with it, you had to learn how, instead of being constantly on edge. And that’s what Kate was, in essence, showing Milly tonight.</i></p></div>

She gave away publicly, in this process, Lancaster
Gate and everything it contained; she gave away,
hand over hand, Milly's thrill continued to note,
Aunt Maud and Aunt Maud's glories and Aunt
Maud's complacencies; she gave herself away most
of all, and it was naturally what most contributed to
her candour. She didn't speak to her friend once
more, in Aunt Maud's strain, of how they could scale
the skies; she spoke, by her bright, perverse preference
on this occasion, of the need, in the first place,
of being neither stupid nor vulgar. It might have
been a lesson, for our young American, in the art of
seeing things as they were—a lesson so various and
so sustained that the pupil had, as we have shown,
but receptively to gape. The odd thing furthermore
was that it could serve its purpose while explicitly
disavowing every personal bias. It wasn't that she
disliked Aunt Maud, who was everything she had on
other occasions declared; but the dear woman, ineffaceably
stamped by inscrutable nature and a dreadful
art, wasn't—how <i>could</i> she be?—what she
wasn't. She wasn't any one. She wasn't anything.
She wasn't anywhere. Milly mustn't think it—one
couldn't, as a good friend, let her. Those hours at
Matcham were <i>inespérées,</i> were pure manna from
heaven; or if not wholly that perhaps, with humbugging
old Lord Mark as a backer, were vain as a
ground for hopes and calculations. Lord Mark was
very well, but he wasn't <i>the</i> cleverest creature in
England, and even if he had been he still wouldn't
have been the most obliging. He weighed it out in
ounces, and indeed each of the pair was really waiting
for what the other would put down.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>In this situation, she openly revealed everything about herself, including her home in Lancaster Gate and everything inside it. Milly was fascinated to see how completely she gave herself away, bit by bit. She also revealed details about Aunt Maud, including her accomplishments and self-satisfaction. Ultimately, she revealed herself the most, which, naturally, made her more honest. She stopped talking to her friend in Aunt Maud’s style, about how they could achieve the impossible. Instead, she chose to focus, in a clear and contrary way, on the importance of not being unintelligent or crass. For our young American friend, it could have been a lesson in seeing things as they truly were, a lesson so comprehensive and consistent that the pupil, as we've seen, could only absorb it passively. The strange part was that the lesson worked even though she denied having any personal preferences. It wasn't that she disliked Aunt Maud, who embodied everything she had previously described, but the dear woman, shaped indelibly by nature and a terrible kind of art, wasn't—how could she be?—what she wasn't. She didn't have a true identity. She was nothing. She was nowhere. Milly shouldn't believe it—and as a good friend, she couldn't allow it. Those hours at Matcham were unexpected, like a gift from heaven. Or, maybe not quite that, with old Lord Mark, who was full of it, backing them up, it was a waste of time to build hopes and make plans. Lord Mark was fine, but he wasn’t the smartest person in England, and even if he was, he wouldn’t be the most helpful. He measured everything carefully, and in reality, they were both waiting to see what the other would contribute.</i></p></div>

"Lest"—Kate took it up—"he should suddenly
grab me and run? Oh, as he isn't ready to run, he's
much less ready, naturally, to grab. I <i>am</i>—you're
so far right as that—on the counter, when I'm not
in the shop-window; in and out of which I'm thus
conveniently, commercially whisked: the essence, all
of it, of my position, and the price, as properly, of
my aunt's protection." Lord Mark was substantially
what she had begun with as soon as they were
alone; the impression was even yet with Milly of
her having sounded his name, having imposed it, as
a topic, in direct opposition to the other name that
Mrs. Lowder had left in the air and that all her own
look, as we have seen, kept there at first for her companion.
The immediate strange effect had been that
of her consciously needing, as it were, an alibi—which,
successfully, she so found. She had worked
it to the end, ridden it to and fro across the course
marked for Milly by Aunt Maud, and now she had
quite, so to speak, broken it in. "The bore is that
if she wants him so much—wants him, heaven forgive
her! for <i>me</i>—he has put us all out, since your
arrival, by wanting somebody else. I don't mean
somebody else than you."

All of which made for the impression, fantastic
or not, of the <i>alibi.</i> The splendour, the grandeur
were, for Milly, the bold ironic spirit behind it, so
interesting too in itself. What, moreover, was not
less interesting was the fact, as our young woman
noted it, that Kate confined her point to the difficulties,
so far as <i>she</i> was concerned, raised only by Lord
Mark. She referred now to none that her own taste
might present; which circumstance again played its
little part. She was doing what she liked in respect
to another person, but she was in no way committed
to the other person, and her furthermore talking of
Lord Mark as not young and not true were only the
signs of her clear self-consciousness, were all in the
line of her slightly hard, but scarce the less graceful
extravagance. She didn't wish to show too much
her consent to be arranged for, but that was a different
thing from not wishing sufficiently to give it.
There was something moreover, on it all, that Milly
still found occasion to say, "If your aunt has been,
as you tell me, put out by me, I feel that she has
remained remarkably kind."
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>All of this created the (whether real or imagined) impression of an alibi. The wealth and luxury were, for Milly, the surprisingly ironic spirit behind it all, and that was fascinating in itself. What was also interesting was that Kate only mentioned the problems that Lord Mark caused, as Milly observed. Kate didn't mention any personal preferences that might create obstacles. This also played a small role in the situation. Kate was doing what she wanted with another person involved, but she wasn't obligated to that other person. Her comments about Lord Mark – that he wasn't young and wasn't genuine – were simply signs of her awareness of herself. They were part of her slightly tough, but still graceful, way of acting. She didn't want to seem too eager to be manipulated, but that was different from not being willing enough to allow it.</i></p><p><i>Moreover, Milly still felt compelled to say, "If your aunt is annoyed with me, as you say, she's certainly been remarkably kind about it."</i></p></div>

"Oh, but she has—whatever might have happened
in that respect—plenty of use for you! You
put her in, my dear, more than you put her out. You
don't half see it, but she has clutched your petticoat.
You can do anything—you can do, I mean, lots that
<i>we</i> can't. You're an outsider, independent and
standing by yourself; you're not hideously relative
to tiers and tiers of others." And Kate, facing in
that direction, went further and further; wound up,
while Milly gaped, with extraordinary words.
"We're of no use to you—it's decent to tell you.
You'd be of use to us, but that's a different matter.
My honest advice to you would be—" she went
indeed all lengths—"to drop us while you can. It
would be funny if you didn't soon see how awfully
better you can do. We've not really done for you
the least thing worth speaking of—nothing you
mightn't easily have had in some other way. Therefore
you're under no obligation. You won't want
us next year; we shall only continue to want <i>you.</i>
But that's no reason for you, and you mustn't pay
too dreadfully for poor Mrs. Stringham's having let
you in. She has the best conscience in the world;
she's enchanted with what she has done; but you
shouldn't take your people from <i>her.</i> It has been
quite awful to see you do it."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Oh, but she really does need you – whatever may have happened before. You're far more helpful to her than you realize. You've become important to her. You can do anything – I mean, a lot of things we can't. You're independent, on your own; you're not tied to this network of people like we are." And Kate, looking that way, kept going; getting really fired up, while Milly stared, as Kate said some surprising things.</i></p><p><i>"We can't help you, and it's only right to tell you that. You could help us, but that's a separate issue. My honest advice to you would be…" she went on and on, “…to leave us while you still can. It would be ridiculous if you didn't soon realize how much better off you'd be without us. We haven't really done anything for you that was really worth anything – nothing you couldn't have easily gotten somewhere else. So you don't owe us anything. You won't need us next year; we'll be the ones needing you. But that's not a reason for you to stay, and you shouldn't suffer too much because Mrs. Stringham got you involved. She has the best intentions; she's thrilled with what she's done; but you shouldn't depend on us. It's been terrible to watch you do it."</i></p></div>

Milly tried to be amused, so as not—it was too
absurd—to be fairly frightened. Strange enough
indeed—if not natural enough—that, late at night
thus, in a mere mercenary house, with Susie away,
a want of confidence should possess her. She recalled,
with all the rest of it, the next day, piecing
things together in the dawn, that she had felt herself
alone with a creature who paced like a panther.
That was a violent image, but it made her a little less
ashamed of having been scared. For all her scare,
none the less, she had now the sense to find words.
"And yet without Susie I shouldn't have had you."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly tried to act entertained, because it was ridiculous to be genuinely scared. It was certainly strange – though probably not surprising – that she’d feel insecure, late at night like this, in a cheap boarding house, with Susie gone. When she thought about it the next day, putting the pieces together in the morning light, she remembered feeling alone with someone who moved like a panther. That was an over-the-top image, but it helped her feel less embarrassed about being frightened. Despite her fear, she could now articulate her thoughts.

Really at last, thus, it had been too much; as, with
her own least feeble flare, after a wondering watch,
Milly had shown. She hadn't cared; she had too
much wanted to know; and, though a small solemnity
of reproach, a sombre strain, had broken into
her tone, it was to figure as her nearest approach to
serving Mrs. Lowder. "Why do you say such
things to me?"

This unexpectedly had acted, by a sudden turn of
Kate's attitude, as a happy speech. She had risen
as she spoke, and Kate had stopped before her, shining
at her instantly with a softer brightness. Poor
Milly hereby enjoyed one of her views of how people,
wincing oddly, were often touched by her.
"Because you're a dove." With which she felt herself
ever so delicately, so considerately, embraced;
not with familiarity or as a liberty taken, but almost
ceremonially and in the manner of an accolade; partly
as if, though a dove who could perch on a finger, one
were also a princess with whom forms were to be
observed. It even came to her, through the touch
of her companion's lips, that this form, this cool pressure,
fairly sealed the sense of what Kate had just
said. It was moreover, for the girl, like an inspiration:
she found herself accepting as the right one,
while she caught her breath with relief, the name so
given her. She met it on the instant as she would
have met the revealed truth; it lighted up the strange
dusk in which she lately had walked. <i>That</i> was
what was the matter with her. She was a dove.
Oh, <i>wasn't</i> she?—it echoed within her as she became
aware of the sound, outside, of the return of their
friends. There was, the next thing, little enough
doubt about it after Aunt Maud had been two minutes
in the room. She had come up, Mrs. Lowder,
with Susan—which she needn't have done, at that
hour, instead of letting Kate come down to her; so
that Milly could be quite sure it was to catch hold,
in some way, of the loose end they had left. Well,
the way she did catch was simply to make the point
that it didn't now in the least matter. She had
mounted the stairs for this, and she had her moment
again with her younger hostess while Kate, on the
spot, as the latter at the time noted, gave Susan
Shepherd unwonted opportunities. Kate was in
other words, as Aunt Maud engaged her friend, listening
with the handsomest response to Mrs. Stringham's
impression of the scene they had just quitted.
It was in the tone of the fondest indulgence—almost,
really, that of dove cooing to dove—that Mrs. Lowder
expressed to Milly the hope that it had all gone
beautifully. Her "all" had an ample benevolence;
it soothed and simplified; she spoke as if it were the
two young women, not she and her comrade, who
had been facing the town together. But Milly's
answer had prepared itself while Aunt Maud was on
the stair; she had felt in a rush all the reasons that
would make it the most dovelike; and she gave it,
while she was about it, as earnest, as candid. "I
don't <i>think,</i> dear lady, he's here."

She'd climbed the stairs for this, and she had her moment alone with the younger hostess while Kate, as she noticed, gave Susan Shepherd an unusual amount of attention.

It gave her straightway the measure of the success
she could have as a dove: that was recorded in the
long look of deep criticism, a look without a word,
that Mrs. Lowder poured forth. And the word,
presently, bettered it still. "Oh, you exquisite
thing!" The luscious innuendo of it, almost startling,
lingered in the room, after the visitors had
gone, like an oversweet fragrance. But left alone
with Mrs. Stringham Milly continued to breathe it:
she studied again the dovelike and so set her companion
to mere rich reporting that she averted all inquiry
into her own case.

That, with the new day, was once more her law—though
she saw before her, of course, as something
of a complication, her need, each time, to decide.
She should have to be clear as to how a dove <i>would</i>
act. She settled it, she thought, well enough this
morning by quite readopting her plan in respect to
Sir Luke Strett. That, she was pleased to reflect,
had originally been pitched in the key of a merely iridescent
drab; and although Mrs. Stringham, after
breakfast, began by staring at it as if it had been a
priceless Persian carpet suddenly unrolled at her
feet, she had no scruple, at the end of five minutes,
in leaving her to make the best of it. "Sir Luke
Strett comes, by appointment, to see me at eleven,
but I'm going out on purpose. He's to be told,
please, deceptively, that I'm at home, and, you, as
my representative, when he comes up, are to see him
instead. He will like that, this time, better. So do
be nice to him." It had taken, naturally, more explanation,
and the mention, above all, of the fact that
the visitor was the greatest of doctors; yet when
once the key had been offered Susie slipped it on her
bunch, and her young friend could again feel her
lovely imagination operate. It operated in truth
very much as Mrs. Lowder's, at the last, had done
the night before: it made the air heavy once more
with the extravagance of assent. It might, afresh,
almost have frightened our young woman to see how
people rushed to meet her: <i>had</i> she then so little
time to live that the road must always be spared her?
It was as if they were helping her to take it out on
the spot. Susie—she couldn't deny, and didn't pretend
to—might, of a truth, on <i>her</i> side, have treated
such news as a flash merely lurid; as to which, to
do Susie justice, the pain of it was all there. But,
none the less, the margin always allowed her young
friend was all there as well; and the proposal now
made her what was it in short but Byzantine?
The vision of Milly's perception of the propriety of
the matter had, at any rate, quickly engulfed, so far
as her attitude was concerned, any surprise and any
shock; so that she only desired, the next thing, perfectly
to possess the facts. Milly could easily speak,
on this, as if there were only one: she made nothing
of such another as that she had felt herself menaced.
The great fact, in fine, was that she <i>knew</i>
him to desire just now, more than anything else, to
meet, quite apart, some one interested in her. Who
therefore so interested as her faithful Susan? The
only other circumstance that, by the time she had
quitted her friend, she had treated as worth mentioning
was the circumstance of her having at first
intended to keep quiet. She had originally best seen
herself as sweetly secretive. As to that she had
changed, and her present request was the result.
She didn't say why she had changed, but she trusted
her faithful Susan. Their visitor would trust her
not less, and she herself would adore their visitor.
Moreover he wouldn't—the girl felt sure—tell her
anything dreadful. The worst would be that he
was in love and that he needed a confidant to work
it. And now she was going to the National Gallery.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>As the new day began, she was once again faced with her usual routine, though she found the need to make a decision each time a bit complicated. She needed to be as decisive as a dove. She decided, she thought, this morning was well-handled by simply re-committing to her plan regarding Sir Luke Strett. That plan, she was pleased to recall, had initially been presented in a subtle, understated way. And although Mrs. Stringham, after breakfast, reacted to the plan as if it were a priceless Persian carpet suddenly unfurled at her feet, she didn’t hesitate after five minutes to leave her to process it. "Sir Luke Strett is scheduled to see me at eleven, but I'm going out on purpose. Please tell him, in a misleading way, that I'm home, and you, as my stand-in, should see him instead. He'll prefer that this time. So please be nice to him." It required, of course, a more detailed explanation, especially mentioning that the visitor was a renowned doctor. But once Susie understood the key point, she embraced it, and her young friend could again feel her wonderful imagination at work. It functioned, in fact, much like Mrs. Lowder's had the previous night: it again made the atmosphere thick with enthusiastic agreement.
