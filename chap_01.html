<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Kate Croy waits in her father's shabby lodgings. While waiting, she moves between the sofa and an armchair, looks at the prints on the wall, and stands on the balcony. She also looks at her reflection in a mirror over the mantel, readjusting her hat and hair.</p><p>Her father, Lionel Croy, eventually enters. He says he has been to the chemist because he is unwell. Kate tells him he looks well and then says she is willing to go away and live with him. He expresses surprise and refuses her offer.</p><p>Kate explains that her Aunt Maud has made her a proposal with one condition: that Kate must break off all contact with her father. In response, Kate has come to him. Mr. Croy says this is a proper requirement from her aunt and advises Kate to accept the offer. He tells her she should use him to get a better deal from her aunt, suggesting she make her aunt feel how much of a sacrifice it is to give him up. He advises her to marry a man her aunt selects, after which he will resume relations with her.</p><p>Kate again offers to choose him over her aunt and asks him to stand with her. He refuses, calls her sick, and accuses her of being in love with someone her aunt disapproves of. He opens the door for her to leave. He asks who the man is, and Kate replies that the man wants to be kind to him. Mr. Croy forbids her from marrying anyone her aunt disapproves of and threatens to make her regret it if she defies them. Kate says she is not afraid of him.</p><p>He gives her his final advice and reveals his anger that she gives half of her inheritance to her sister, Marian, instead of to him.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study.</p><p>### Kate Croy</p><p>Kate is introduced in a state of controlled impatience and disgust with her surroundings, which she sees as a direct reflection of her family’s “failure of fortune and of honour.” She is presented as proud, self-aware, and resilient; while observing the shabby room, she also observes her own handsome reflection in the mirror, affirming her personal value as separate from her family's collapse.</p><p>Her situation shifts due to an ultimatum from her Aunt Maud: she will be taken care of financially if she completely severs ties with her father. In response, Kate makes a decisive move, coming to her father not to abandon him but to offer to live with him and reject her aunt’s proposal. When he refuses, deducing she is in love with someone her aunt disapproves of, her situation shifts again. She is left isolated, rejected by the father she offered to save, and must now proceed alone.</p><p>### Lionel Croy (The Father)</p><p>Mr. Croy is presented through his absence and deception before he even appears. He has lied about being ill and inhabits a "vulgar" space that belies his appearance. When he enters, he is a man of profound contradictions: physically immaculate, charming, and looking the part of a "perfectly" respectable English gentleman, yet he is entirely untrustworthy, manipulative, and amoral. He "dealt out lies" and his polished exterior serves to mask his inner corruption.</p><p>His situation is immediately challenged by Kate’s unexpected offer. His initial plan was to make a grand, noble show of sacrificing her for her own good. When she preempts this, he is momentarily "disconcerted" but quickly pivots. His shift is from feigned parental concern to that of a cynical strategist, advising Kate to leverage her "duty" to him to get a better financial deal from her aunt. He ultimately rejects Kate’s genuine appeal for solidarity, revealing his core motivation is not parental feeling but resentment that she gave her inheritance money to her sister instead of to him.</p>

She waited, Kate Croy, for her father to come
in, but he kept her unconscionably, and there
were moments at which she showed herself, in the
glass over the mantel, a face positively pale with
the irritation that had brought her to the point of
going away without sight of him. It was at this
point, however, that she remained; changing her
place, moving from the shabby sofa to the armchair
upholstered in a glazed cloth that gave at
once—she had tried it—the sense of the slippery and
of the sticky. She had looked at the sallow prints
on the walls and at the lonely magazine, a year old,
that combined, with a small lamp in coloured glass
and a knitted white centre-piece wanting in freshness,
to enhance the effect of the purplish cloth on
the principal table; she had above all, from time to
time, taken a brief stand on the small balcony to
which the pair of long windows gave access. The
vulgar little street, in this view, offered scant relief
from the vulgar little room; its main office was to
suggest to her that the narrow black house-fronts,
adjusted to a standard that would have been low
even for backs, constituted quite the publicity implied
by such privacies. One felt them in the room
exactly as one felt the room—the hundred like it
or worse—in the street. Each time she turned in
again, each time, in her impatience, she gave him
up, it was to sound to a deeper depth, while she
tasted the faint, flat emanation of things, the failure
of fortune and of honour. If she continued to wait
it was really, in a manner, that she might not add
the shame of fear, of individual, personal collapse,
to all the other shames. To feel the street, to feel
the room, to feel the table-cloth and the centre-piece
and the lamp, gave her a small, salutary sense, at
least, of neither shirking nor lying. This whole
vision was the worst thing yet—as including, in particular,
the interview for which she had prepared
herself; and for what had she come but for the
worst? She tried to be sad, so as not to be angry;
but it made her angry that she couldn't be sad. And
yet where was misery, misery too beaten for blame
and chalk-marked by fate like a "lot" at a common
auction, if not in these merciless signs of mere
mean, stale feelings?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate Croy waited for her father to come in, but he was taking an unreasonably long time. At moments, she saw her own face in the mirror above the fireplace, and it was visibly pale with the frustration that had almost made her leave without seeing him. However, she stayed. She changed positions, moving from the worn sofa to an armchair covered in a slick, glazed fabric that felt both slippery and sticky – she’d already tested it. She’d looked at the dull prints on the walls, and the lonely, year-old magazine, which, along with a small colored-glass lamp and a faded, knitted white doily, only emphasized the dingy purple tablecloth on the main table. Most of all, she’d occasionally stepped onto the small balcony accessible through the long windows. The unpleasant little street outside offered no escape from the unpleasant little room. It mostly made her think that the narrow, black house fronts, built to a standard that would be low even for the back of buildings, were a perfect representation of the hidden lives within. You felt the rooms exactly as you felt the street—filled with hundreds just like it, or worse. Every time she turned back inside, every time she almost gave up on him in her impatience, she sank deeper into despair, tasting the stale, lifeless atmosphere of failure and disgrace. If she kept waiting, it was really so she wouldn't have to add the shame of fear and personal breakdown to all the other problems she was facing. To feel the street, to feel the room, to feel the tablecloth and doily and lamp, at least gave her the small, comforting feeling that she wasn't avoiding the truth or lying to herself. This whole experience was the worst thing yet, especially the meeting she had prepared for. Why else had she come, but for the worst? She tried to be sad, so she wouldn't be angry, but it made her angry that she couldn’t even be sad. And yet, where else could misery be found—misery too battered to complain, marked by fate like a discarded item at a public sale—if not in these unrelenting signs of ordinary, stale feelings?</i></p></div>

<p>
Her father's life, her sister's, her own, that of
her two lost brothers—the whole history of their
house had the effect of some fine florid, voluminous
phrase, say even a musical, that dropped first into
words, into notes, without sense, and then, hanging
unfinished, into no words, no notes at all. Why
should a set of people have been put in motion, on
such a scale and with such an air of being equipped
for a profitable journey, only to break down without
an accident, to stretch themselves in the wayside
dust without a reason? The answer to these questions
was not in Chirk Street, but the questions themselves
bristled there, and the girl's repeated pause
before the mirror and the chimney-place might
have represented her nearest approach to an escape
from them. Was it not in fact the partial escape
from this "worst" in which she was steeped to be
able to make herself out again as agreeable to see?
She stared into the tarnished glass too hard indeed
to be staring at her beauty alone. She readjusted
the poise of her black, closely-feathered hat; retouched,
beneath it, the thick fall of her dusky hair;
kept her eyes, aslant, no less on her beautiful averted
than on her beautiful presented oval. She was
dressed altogether in black, which gave an even
tone, by contrast, to her clear face and made her
hair more harmoniously dark. Outside, on the balcony,
her eyes showed as blue; within, at the mirror,
they showed almost as black. She was handsome,
but the degree of it was not sustained by
items and aids; a circumstance moreover playing
its part at almost any time in the impression she
produced. The impression was one that remained,
but as regards the sources of it no sum in addition
would have made up the total. She had stature
without height, grace without motion, presence
without mass. Slender and simple, frequently
soundless, she was somehow always in the line of
the eye—she counted singularly for its pleasure.
More "dressed," often, with fewer accessories, than
other women, or less dressed, should occasion require,
with more, she probably could not have given
the key to these felicities. They were mysteries of
which her friends were conscious—those friends
whose general explanation was to say that she was
clever, whether or no it were taken by the world as
the cause or as the effect of her charm. If she saw
more things than her fine face in the dull glass of
her father's lodgings, she might have seen that, after
all, she was not herself a fact in the collapse. She
didn't judge herself cheap, she didn't make for
misery. Personally, at least, she was not chalk-marked
for the auction. She hadn't given up yet,
and the broken sentence, if she was the last word,
would end with a sort of meaning. There was a
minute during which, though her eyes were fixed,
she quite visibly lost herself in the thought of the
way she might still pull things round had she only
been a man. It was the name, above all, she would
take in hand—the precious name she so liked and
that, in spite of the harm her wretched father had
done it, was not yet past praying for. She loved it
in fact the more tenderly for that bleeding wound.
But what could a penniless girl do with it but let
it go?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The history of her family—her father's life, her sister's, her own, and that of her two brothers who had died—was like a beautiful, complex story, perhaps even a musical piece. It started with words and notes, full of promise, but then stopped abruptly, never reaching a conclusion. Why had this family been set in motion, with such grand expectations and the appearance of preparing for a successful journey, only to fail without a clear cause, collapsing on the side of the road with no apparent reason?</i></p><p><i>The answer to these questions wasn't to be found on Chirk Street, but the questions themselves were ever-present, haunting her. The girl's frequent moments of contemplation in front of the mirror and the fireplace might have been her closest attempt to escape them. Wasn't it a way to escape the "worst" of her situation to be able to make herself look appealing again? She gazed intently into the tarnished mirror, not just admiring her beauty. She adjusted her black, feathered hat, smoothed her dark hair, and observed both her beautiful profile and the face she presented to the world.</i></p><p><i>She was completely dressed in black, which emphasized her fair complexion and made her hair appear even darker. Her eyes looked blue on the balcony and almost black in the mirror. She was attractive, but her appeal wasn't dependent on any particular features or accessories. This was a significant aspect of the impression she created. The impression remained, but no amount of analysis could fully explain it. She possessed a graceful presence, a strong character, without the obvious physical attributes. She was slender and unassuming, often quiet, but somehow always caught the eye—she was uniquely pleasing to look at. She was often "more dressed" with fewer accessories than other women, or conversely, less dressed with more, but she couldn't explain how she achieved these effects. Her friends were aware of these mysteries, and they generally explained it by saying she was intelligent, whether they believed her intelligence was the cause or the result of her charm.</i></p><p><i>If she saw more than just her pretty face in the dull mirror of her father's home, she might have realized that she wasn't a victim of her family's downfall. She didn't see herself as worthless, and she wasn't consumed by sadness. Personally, at least, she wasn't destined to be ruined. She hadn't given up hope, and if she were the last one standing, the unfinished story would eventually find some resolution. For a moment, her eyes fixed, she lost herself in the thought of how she could still turn things around if she were a man. It was the family name, above all, that she wanted to salvage—the cherished name she loved, which, despite her father's mistakes, could still be redeemed. In fact, she loved it even more tenderly because of its wounded state.</i></p><p><i>But what could a poor girl do with it but let it go?</i></p></div>

When her father at last appeared she became, as
usual, instantly aware of the futility of any effort
to hold him to anything. He had written her that
he was ill, too ill to leave his room, and that he
must see her without delay; and if this had been,
as was probable, the sketch of a design, he was indifferent
even to the moderate finish required for
deception. He had clearly wanted, for perversities
that he called reasons, to see her, just as she herself
had sharpened for a talk; but she now again felt, in
the inevitability of the freedom he used with her,
all the old ache, her poor mother's very own, that
he couldn't touch you ever so lightly without setting
up. No relation with him could be so short
or so superficial as not to be somehow to your hurt;
and this, in the strangest way in the world, not
because he desired it to be—feeling often, as he
surely must, the profit for him of its not being—but
because there was never a mistake for you that
he could leave unmade or a conviction of his impossibility
in you that he could approach you without
strengthening. He might have awaited her on
the sofa in his sitting-room, or might have stayed
in bed and received her in that situation. She was
glad to be spared the sight of such <i>penetralia,</i> but
it would have reminded her a little less that there
was no truth in him. This was the weariness of
every fresh meeting; he dealt out lies as he might
the cards from the greasy old pack for the game
of diplomacy to which you were to sit down with
him. The inconvenience—as always happens in
such cases—was not that you minded what was
false, but that you missed what was true. He might
be ill, and it might suit you to know it, but no contact
with him, for this, could ever be straight enough.
Just so he even might die, but Kate fairly wondered
on what evidence of his own she would some day
have to believe it.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>When her father finally showed up, she immediately realized, as always, how pointless it was to try to pin him down. He'd written that he was sick, too sick to leave his room, and that he needed to see her urgently. If that had been a manipulative ploy—which it probably was—he hadn't even bothered to make it believable. He clearly just wanted to see her, for reasons he considered valid, just as she had been looking forward to a conversation. But now she felt again, in the inescapable way he used her, all the familiar pain, the same kind her poor mother had felt, the way he couldn't even touch you gently without causing a reaction. No interaction with him could be brief or superficial enough to avoid hurting you somehow. And this, strangely, wasn't because he wanted to inflict pain – he probably recognized it would be better for him if it didn’t – but because he couldn't help but make any mistake possible and always reinforced your doubts about him. He could have been waiting for her on the sofa in his living room, or he could have stayed in bed and received her there. She was glad she didn't have to see his inner sanctum, but it would have reminded her less of how untruthful he was. This was the exhaustion of every meeting: he dispensed lies as easily as dealing cards from a dirty old deck for a game of manipulation you were forced to play with him. The problem—as always in these situations—wasn't that you minded the lies, but that you missed the truth. He might be sick, and it might suit her to know it, but no interaction with him, even for this, could ever be straightforward. He might even die, Kate thought, but she wondered what proof she'd ever have to believe it.</i></p></div>

He had not at present come down from his room,
which she knew to be above the one they were in:
he had already been out of the house, though he
would either, should she challenge him, deny it or
present it as a proof of his extremity. She had,
however, by this time, quite ceased to challenge him;
not only, face to face with him, vain irritation
dropped, but he breathed upon the tragic consciousness
in such a way that after a moment nothing of
it was left. The difficulty was not less that he
breathed in the same way upon the comic: she almost
believed that with this latter she might still
have found a foothold for clinging to him. He had
ceased to be amusing—he was really too inhuman.
His perfect look, which had floated him so long, was
practically perfect still; but one had long since for
every occasion taken it for granted. Nothing could
have better shown than the actual how right one
had been. He looked exactly as much as usual—all
pink and silver as to skin and hair, all straitness
and starch as to figure and dress—the man in
the world least connected with anything unpleasant.
He was so particularly the English gentleman and
the fortunate, settled, normal person. Seen at a
foreign <i>table d'hôte,</i> he suggested but one thing:
"In what perfection England produces them!" He
had kind, safe eyes, and a voice which, for all its
clean fulness, told, in a manner, the happy history
of its having never had once to raise itself. Life
had met him so, half-way, and had turned round so
to walk with him, placing a hand in his arm and
fondly leaving him to choose the pace. Those who
knew him a little said, "How he does dress!"—those
who knew him better said, "How <i>does</i> he?"
The one stray gleam of comedy just now in his
daughter's eyes was the funny feeling he momentarily
made her have of being herself "looked up" by
him in sordid lodgings. For a minute after he came
in it was as if the place were her own and he the visitor
with susceptibilities. He gave you funny feelings,
he had indescribable arts, that quite turned the
tables: that had been always how he came to see
her mother so long as her mother would see him.
He came from places they had often not known
about, but he patronised Lexham Gardens. Kate's
only actual expression of impatience, however, was
"I'm glad you're so much better!"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He hadn't come downstairs yet; she knew he was in the room above them. He'd already been outside, although if she confronted him, he would either deny it or present it as evidence of his desperation. However, she'd stopped challenging him entirely. It wasn't just that her anger faded when she was with him, but he had a way of downplaying the painful things in her life so that, after a little while, she forgot about them. The problem was that he also did the same with anything funny or lighthearted; she almost thought she could still connect with him if she focused on that. He wasn't even amusing anymore; he was simply too cold and unfeeling. His flawless appearance, which had served him so well for so long, was still almost perfect, but she'd long since stopped paying attention to it. The reality of the situation just confirmed how right she'd been. He looked exactly the same as always – all pink and silver with his skin and hair, all crispness and formality in his posture and clothes – the most detached and carefree person in the world. He was the epitome of the English gentleman, the fortunate, well-adjusted, and ordinary man. If you saw him at a foreign hotel, you would think, "How perfectly England produces them!" He had kind, reassuring eyes and a voice that, despite its pleasant fullness, clearly showed he'd never had to raise it in any kind of distress. Life had met him halfway, embraced him, and walked with him, offering him its arm and letting him choose the pace. Those who knew him superficially would say, "How well-dressed he is!" – those who knew him better would wonder, "How does he manage?"</i></p><p><i>The only flicker of amusement in his daughter's eyes at that moment was the fleeting sensation he gave her of being "looked up to" by him in their humble lodgings.

He had a way of making you feel ridiculous; he had these strange skills that completely flipped the situation. That's how he had always gotten away with seeing her mother as long as her mother allowed him to. He went to places they didn't know about, but he treated their neighborhood with condescension.

"I'm not so much better, my dear—I'm exceedingly
unwell; the proof of which is, precisely, that
I've been out to the chemist's—that beastly fellow
at the corner." So Mr. Croy showed he could
qualify the humble hand that assuaged him. "I'm

"Oh papa, it's long since I've ceased to see you
otherwise than as you really are! I think we've
all arrived by this time at the right word for that:
'You're beautiful—<i>n'en parlons plus.'</i> You're as
beautiful as ever—you look lovely." He judged
meanwhile her own appearance, as she knew she
could always trust him to do; recognising, estimating,
sometimes disapproving, what she wore, showing
her the interest he continued to take in her. He
might really take none at all, yet she virtually knew
herself the creature in the world to whom he was
least indifferent. She had often enough wondered
what on earth, at the pass he had reached, could
give him pleasure, and she had come back, on these
occasions, to that. It gave him pleasure that she
was handsome, that she was, in her way, a sensible
value. It was at least as marked, nevertheless, that
he derived none from similar conditions, so far as
they <i>were</i> similar, in his other child. Poor Marian
might be handsome, but he certainly didn't care.
The hitch here, of course, was that, with whatever
beauty, her sister, widowed and almost in want, with
four bouncing children, was not a sensible value.
She asked him, the next thing, how long he had been
in his actual quarters, though aware of how little
it mattered, how little any answer he might make
would probably have in common with the truth.
She failed in fact to notice his answer, truthful or
not, already occupied as she was with what she had
on her own side to say to him. This was really what
had made her wait—what superseded the small
remainder of her resentment at his constant practical
impertinence; the result of all of which was that,
within a minute, she had brought it out. "Yes—even
now I'm willing to go with you. I don't know
what you may have wished to say to me, and even
if you hadn't written you would within a day or
two have heard from me. Things have happened,
and I've only waited, for seeing you, till I should be
quite sure. I <i>am</i> quite sure. I'll go with you."

I think we've finally landed on the right word for it: 'You're wonderful – let's not talk about it anymore.' You're still as wonderful as ever—you look great." He was sizing up her appearance at the same time, as she knew he always would; noticing, evaluating, sometimes disapproving of what she was wearing, showing her he still cared about her. He might not actually care, but she knew she was the person in the world he cared about the most. She'd often wondered what could possibly bring him joy at this stage of his life, and she always came back to this: it pleased him that she was attractive, that she was, in her own way, a worthwhile asset. It was also very clear, however, that he didn't get any satisfaction from the same things, as far as they were similar, in his other child.

Lionel Croy hung about in his disengaged way—hovered
there as if, in consequence of her words,
looking for a pretext to back out easily: on which
she immediately saw she had discounted, as it
might be called, what he had himself been preparing.
He wished her not to come to him, still less to
settle with him, and had sent for her to give her
up with some style and state; a part of the beauty
of which, however, was to have been his sacrifice
to her own detachment. There was no style, no
state, unless she wished to forsake him. His idea
had accordingly been to surrender her to her wish
with all nobleness; it had by no means been to have
positively to keep her off. She cared, however, not
a straw for his embarrassment—feeling how little,
on her own part, she was moved by charity. She
had seen him, first and last, in so many attitudes that
she could now deprive him quite without compunction
of the luxury of a new one. Yet she felt the
disconcerted gasp in his tone as he said: "Oh my
child, I can never consent to that!"

But she immediately realized that she’d underestimated something: he was actually planning the same thing. He didn’t want her to come to him, especially not to be with him permanently. He had called her to break things off with some flair and formality. The plan was that part of the elegance of the breakup would be him sacrificing himself for her sake, to make it appear that he was being noble. There was no style or grace unless she was the one who wanted to leave him. His plan had been to gracefully let her have what she wanted, but definitely not to actively push her away. However, she didn’t care at all about his discomfort, because she knew she wasn’t feeling any sympathy herself. She’d seen him in so many different moods that she could now completely disregard his feelings without any guilt. And yet, she noticed the shocked sound in his voice when he said, "Oh my dear, I can never agree to that!"</i></p></div>

Standing before her with his hands behind him
and his legs a little apart, he swayed slightly to and
fro, inclined toward her as if rising on his toes. It
had an effect of conscientious deliberation. "No.
I haven't. I couldn't. I wouldn't." It was so respectable,
a show that she felt afresh, and with the
memory of their old despair, the despair at home,
how little his appearance ever by any chance told
about him. His plausibility had been the heaviest
of her mother's crosses; inevitably so much more
present to the world than whatever it was that was
horrid—thank God they didn't really know!—that
he had done. He had positively been, in his way,
by the force of his particular type, a terrible husband
not to live with; his type reflecting so invidiously
on the woman who had found him distasteful.
Had this thereby not kept directly present to Kate
herself that it might, on some sides, prove no light
thing for her to leave uncompanioned a parent with
such a face and such a manner? Yet if there was
much she neither knew nor dreamed of, it passed
between them at this very moment that he was quite
familiar with himself as the subject of such quandaries.
If he recognised his younger daughter's
happy aspect as a sensible value, he had from the
first still more exactly appraised his own. The great
wonder was not that in spite of everything his own
had helped him; the great wonder was that it hadn't
helped him more. However, it was, to its old,
eternal, recurrent tune, helping him all the while;
her drop into patience with him showed how it
was helping him at this moment. She saw the next
instant precisely the line he would take. "Do you
really ask me to believe you've been making up your
mind to that?"

He leaned towards her, as if he were about to stand on his toes. It gave the impression of careful consideration. "No. I haven't. I couldn't. I wouldn't." His respectable facade, something she was keenly aware of, reminded her of their past struggles, of the hopelessness at home, and how little his outward appearance ever revealed about the true man. His charm had been a great burden to her mother. It was always more visible to the outside world than whatever terrible things he had done—thank God no one truly knew! He had, in his own way and due to his personality, been a terrible husband to live with. His very nature reflected poorly on the woman who found him repulsive.</i></p><p><i>Hadn't this constantly reminded Kate that leaving her father, with his face and manner, alone might not be easy for her? Even though there was much she didn't know or understand, they both understood at this moment that he was well aware of how he was a source of these kinds of questions. While he acknowledged that his younger daughter’s happiness was valuable, he had from the beginning had an even more exact understanding of his own. The real surprise wasn't that his own personality had helped him; the real surprise was that it hadn't helped him more. However, it was, with its old, familiar, and recurring tune, still helping him. Kate’s acceptance of his presence demonstrated how it was helping him at this moment. She immediately knew exactly what he would say next.

His daughter took in the place again, and it might
well have seemed odd that in so little to meet the

There's in fact, my dear," Mr. Croy wound up,

Your duty, and your chance, if you have any sense, is to use me. Show your family feeling by figuring out what I'm good for. If you understood the situation the way I do, you'd see I'm still valuable – good for a lot of things. The truth is, dear," Mr. Croy concluded, "you can get a great deal out of me."

She had a pause, a grave one, but not, as appeared,
that she might measure this danger. "If I shouldn't
do it, you know, it wouldn't be because I'm afraid
