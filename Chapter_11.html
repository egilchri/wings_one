<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Lord Mark approaches a girl, Milly, and tells her about a portrait in the house that resembles her. He leads her inside to see it. As they walk, they are repeatedly stopped by other guests who greet Lord Mark.</p><p>They arrive at the Bronzino portrait. Milly looks at it through tears and says, "I shall never be better than this." She clarifies to Lord Mark that she means the afternoon has been perfect. They discuss the resemblance between her and the woman in the painting.</p><p>Kate Croy arrives with Lord and Lady Aldershaw. They all agree on the resemblance. Kate tells Milly she looks superb. Lady Aldershaw begins to invite Milly somewhere, but Lord Mark interrupts and leads Lady Aldershaw away. Lord Aldershaw looks at the painting, then follows them, leaving Milly and Kate alone.</p><p>Milly asks Kate to do her a secret service: to go with her to a doctor's appointment the next day. She says the plan is to deceive her companion, Susan Shepherd, to avoid worrying her. Milly explains she has an appointment with a doctor, Sir Luke Strett, and asks Kate to promise absolute silence. Kate asks what is wrong, and Milly says that is what she wants to find out. After a brief discussion, Kate agrees to accompany her.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Initial Presentation:** Milly is presented as a passive, observant young woman who is the object of intense social curiosity. She is aware that a reputation as a "rich young American" precedes her and accepts being put on display with a detached "uplifted assurance." She is initially led by Lord Mark, trusting him and absorbing the social scene around her.</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically upon seeing the Bronzino portrait. Her passivity gives way to a profound and sudden emotional vulnerability, moving her to tears and prompting the fatalistic declaration, "I shall never be better than this." A second shift occurs with Kate’s arrival; Milly moves from being an object of social attention to an active agent of her own affairs. She seizes the initiative, confiding in Kate about a secret visit to a doctor and arranging for her help, thus revealing a hidden, serious anxiety about her health.</li>
<li>*Lord Mark**</li>
<li>**Initial Presentation:** He is presented as a smooth, socially adept, and protective guide. He orchestrates the encounter with Milly, steers her through the crowd with practiced ease, and shields her from unwanted social overtures. He is perceptive in noticing Milly's resemblance to the portrait but completely misinterprets her deep emotional reaction to it, revealing a lack of emotional depth.</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** His situation shifts from being Milly’s primary companion and protector to being sidelined. After Kate Croy arrives and takes control, he is seen strolling away with another guest, his central role in the scene effectively ended.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Initial Presentation:** Kate appears as a confident and socially powerful figure. She arrives and immediately re-frames the scene around herself, confirming the portrait's likeness and managing the other guests with "subtle operation." Her initial reaction to Milly’s request for help is playful and worldly ("Then I'm your woman").</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** She quickly shifts from a social peer to a confidante entrusted with a serious secret. Her demeanor changes from light amusement to direct, concerned inquiry ("What in the world is the matter with you?"). By the end of the passage, she has displaced Lord Mark and established a new, deeply intimate and secretive relationship with Milly.</li></ul>

<p>
A prime reason, we must add, why sundry impressions
were not to be fully present to the girl till later
on was that they yielded at this stage, with an effect
of sharp supersession, to a detached quarter of an
hour—her only one—with Lord Mark. "Have you
seen the picture in the house, the beautiful one that's
so like you?"—he was asking that as he stood before
her; having come up at last with his smooth
intimation that any wire he had pulled and yet
wanted not to remind her of wasn't quite a reason for
his having no joy at all.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Another important reason why she didn't fully understand all the things she was experiencing until later was that those feelings were immediately replaced by a brief, special moment – her only one – with Lord Mark. "Have you seen that painting in the house, the beautiful one that looks so much like you?" he asked, standing in front of her. He had finally approached her, vaguely suggesting that whatever he'd done behind the scenes, which he preferred not to mention, wasn't the sole reason he seemed unhappy.</i></p></div>

</div><div class="section-block">
<div class="original-text">
<p>
"I've been through rooms and I've seen pictures.
But if I'm 'like' anything so beautiful as most of
them seemed to me——!" It needed in short for
Milly some evidence, which he only wanted to supply.
She was the image of the wonderful Bronzino,
which she must have a look at on every ground.
He had thus called her off and led her away; the
more easily that the house within was above all what
had already drawn round her its mystic circle.
Their progress, meanwhile, was not of the straightest;
it was an advance, without haste, through innumerable
natural pauses and soft concussions, determined
for the most part by the appearance before
them of ladies and gentlemen, singly, in couples, in
groups, who brought them to a stand with an inveterate
"I say, Mark." What they said she never
quite made out; it was their all so domestically knowing
him, and his knowing them, that mainly struck
her, while her impression, for the rest, was but of
fellow-strollers more vaguely afloat than themselves,
supernumeraries mostly a little battered, whether as
jaunty males or as ostensibly elegant women. They
might have been moving a good deal by a momentum
that had begun far back, but they were still
brave and personable, still warranted for continuance
as long again, and they gave her, in especial
collectively, a sense of pleasant voices, pleasanter
than those of actors, of friendly, empty words and
kind, lingering eyes. The lingering eyes looked her
over, the lingering eyes were what went, in almost
confessed simplicity, with the pointless "I say,
Mark "; and what was really most sensible of all
was that, as a pleasant matter of course, if she didn't
mind, he seemed to suggest their letting people, poor
dear things, have the benefit of her.

<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>I've seen some pretty amazing places and artwork. But if I'm even *close* to being as beautiful as most of those things seemed to me...!" Basically, Milly needed some proof, and he was happy to provide it. She was like that amazing Bronzino painting, and she needed to see it for herself. He'd pulled her away, which was easy because the house itself was already drawing her in.</i></p><p><i>Their walk wasn't exactly direct; it was a slow journey with lots of natural stops and casual bumps, mostly because they kept running into people – ladies and gentlemen, alone, in pairs, in groups – who would stop them with a casual "Hey, Mark." She never quite understood what they were saying; what struck her was how familiar they all were with him, and his familiarity with them. As for the others, they seemed like casual tourists, a bit worn, both the cheerful men and the seemingly elegant women. They might have been carried along by something that started long ago, but they were still charming and presentable, and seemed like they could keep going forever. Collectively, they gave her a feeling of pleasant voices, even nicer than actors' voices, and friendly, meaningless chatter with kind, lingering gazes. Those lingering eyes looked her over, and those lingering eyes were a part of that pointless "Hey, Mark." And what was really striking was that, in a friendly way, he seemed to suggest that if she didn't mind, they'd let these poor dears have the benefit of seeing her.</i></p></div>

The odd part was that he made her herself believe,
for amusement, in the benefit, measured by him in
mere manner—for wonderful, of a truth, was, as a
means of expression, his slightness of emphasis—that
her present good-nature conferred. It was, as
she could easily see, a mild common carnival of
good-nature—a mass of London people together, of
sorts and sorts, but who mainly knew each other and
who, in their way, did, no doubt, confess to curiosity.
It had gone round that she was there; questions
about her would be passing; the easiest thing was
to run the gauntlet with <i>him</i>—just as the easiest
thing was in fact to trust him generally. Couldn't
she know for herself, passively, how little harm they
meant her?—to that extent that it made no difference
whether or not he introduced them. The
strangest thing of all for Milly was perhaps the uplifted
assurance and indifference with which she
could simply give back the particular bland stare that
appeared in such cases to mark civilisation at its
highest. It was so little her fault, this oddity of
what had "gone round" about her, that to accept
it without question might be as good a way as another
of feeling life. It was inevitable to supply the
probable description—that of the awfully rich young
American who was so queer to behold, but nice, by
all accounts, to know; and she had really but one
instant of speculation as to fables or fantasies perchance
originally launched. She asked herself once
only if Susie could, inconceivably, have been blatant
about her; for the question, on the spot, was really
blown away for ever. She knew in fact on the spot
and with sharpness just why she had "elected"
Susan Shepherd: she had had from the first hour the
conviction of her being precisely the person in the
world least possibly a trumpeter. So it wasn't their
fault, it wasn't their fault, and anything might happen
that would, and everything now again melted
together, and kind eyes were always kind eyes—if it
were never to be worse than that! She got with her
companion into the house; they brushed, beneficently,
past all their accidents. The Bronzino was, it
appeared, deep within, and the long afternoon light
lingered for them on patches of old colour and waylaid
them, as they went, in nooks and opening
vistas.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The strange thing was that he’d convinced her, just for fun, to believe in the positive effects of this—effects he measured solely by her demeanor. His subtle emphasis was, truthfully, quite impressive as a way of conveying meaning. He’d made her believe that her current good mood was helpful. It was, as she could easily see, a pleasant, commonplace gathering. A large group of Londoners, of all kinds, who mostly knew each other and, undoubtedly, were curious about her.</i></p><p><i>Word had spread that she was there.

From the beginning, she had believed that Susie was the last person in the world to gossip.</i></p><p><i>So it wasn’t their fault, it wasn’t their fault. Anything could happen, and everything melted together again. Kind eyes were always kind eyes—as long as it never got any worse than that!

It was all the while for Milly as if Lord Mark had
really had something other than this spoken pretext
in view; as if there were something he wanted to say
to her and were only—consciously yet not awkwardly,
just delicately—hanging fire. At the same time
it was as if the thing had practically been said by the
moment they came in sight of the picture; since
what it appeared to amount to was "Do let a fellow
who isn't a fool take care of you a little." The thing
somehow, with the aid of the Bronzino, was done;
it hadn't seemed to matter to her before if he were
a fool or no; but now, just where they were, she
liked his not being; and it was all moreover none
the worse for coming back to something of the same
sound as Mrs. Lowder's so recent reminder. She
too wished to take care of her—and wasn't it, <i>à peu
près,</i> what all the people with the kind eyes were
wishing? Once more things melted together—the
beauty and the history and the facility and the splendid
midsummer glow: it was a sort of magnificent
maximum, the pink dawn of an apotheosis, coming
so curiously soon. What in fact befell was that, as
she afterwards made out, it was Lord Mark who said
nothing in particular—it was she herself who said
all. She couldn't help that—it came; and the reason
it came was that she found herself, for the first moment,
looking at the mysterious portrait through
tears. Perhaps it was her tears that made it just
then so strange and fair—as wonderful as he had
said: the face of a young woman, all magnificently
drawn, down to the hands, and magnificently
dressed; a face almost livid in hue, yet handsome in
sadness and crowned with a mass of hair rolled back
and high, that must, before fading with time, have
had a family resemblance to her own. The lady in
question, at all events, with her slightly Michaelangelesque
squareness, her eyes of other days, her
full lips, her long neck, her recorded jewels, her brocaded
and wasted reds, was a very great personage—only
unaccompanied by a joy. And she was dead,
dead, dead. Milly recognised her exactly in words
that had nothing to do with her. "I shall never be
better than this."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly felt like Lord Mark had a hidden motive, something more than just the reason he gave for being there. It was as if he wanted to tell her something, but he was holding back, not awkwardly, but deliberately and carefully. At the same time, it was as if he’d already said what he wanted to say, simply by showing her the painting. It was as if he was saying, "Let someone who isn’t an idiot look after you a little." Somehow, with the help of the Bronzino painting, it was accomplished. It hadn't seemed to matter to her before whether he was a fool or not, but now, standing there, she was glad he wasn't. And it was all the better because it echoed Mrs. Lowder's recent offer of help. She also wanted to take care of Milly – and wasn't that what everyone with kind eyes seemed to want? Once again, everything blended together: the beauty, the history, the ease, and the gorgeous summer light. It was a kind of overwhelming peak, the start of something amazing, and it was happening so quickly. In reality, as she realized later, Lord Mark said nothing of significance. It was she who said everything. She couldn’t help it – it just came out. And the reason it came out was that, for the first time, she was looking at the mysterious portrait through tears. Perhaps it was her tears that made it seem so strange and beautiful then—just as wonderful as he had said: the face of a young woman, exquisitely painted down to the hands, dressed in magnificent clothes; a face almost pale, but handsome in its sadness, and framed by a mass of hair piled high, that, before it faded with age, must have looked a little like her own. The woman in the painting, with her slightly angular features, her eyes of another time, her full lips, her long neck, her jewels, her faded red brocade, was a very important person—but she had no joy. And she was dead, dead, dead. Milly understood her perfectly, expressing her understanding in words that had nothing to do with the painting’s subject. "I'll never be better than this," she thought.</i></p></div>

He smiled for her at the portrait. "Than she?
You'd scarce need to be better, for surely that's well
enough. But you <i>are,</i> one feels, as it happens, better;

was good."

He hadn't understood. She was before the picture,
but she had turned to him, and she didn't care
if, for the minute, he noticed her tears. It was probably
as good a moment as she should ever have with
him. It was perhaps as good a moment as she
should have with any one, or have in any connection
whatever. "I mean that everything this afternoon
has been too beautiful, and that perhaps everything
together will never be so right again. I'm very glad
therefore you've been a part of it."

Though he still didn't understand her he was as
nice as if he had; he didn't ask for insistence, and
that was just a part of his looking after her. He
simply protected her now from herself, and there

about these things!"

Ah, they had already done that, she knew, as much
as she ever would; and she was shaking her head at
her pale sister the next moment with a world, on her

"I see it <i>has</i> occurred"—he has already taken her
up. She had her back, as she faced the picture, to
one of the doors of the room, which was open, and
on her turning, as he spoke, she saw that they were
in the presence of three other persons, also, as appeared,
interested inquirers. Kate Croy was one of
these; Lord Mark had just become aware of her,
and she, all arrested, had immediately seen, and made
the best of it, that she was far from being first in
the field. She had brought a lady and a gentleman
to whom she wished to show what Lord Mark was
showing Milly, and he took her straightway as a reinforcement.
Kate herself had spoken, however,
before he had had time to tell her so.

<i>"You</i> had noticed too?"—she smiled at him without
looking at Milly. "Then I'm not original—which

whom again it was, all round indeed, kind, kind
eyes. "Yes, there you are, my dear, if you want to

<i>"Les grands esprits se rencontrent!"</i> laughed her

urbanity by the liberal aid of certain prominent front
teeth and whom Milly vaguely took for some sort of

Lady Aldershaw meanwhile looked at Milly quite
as if Milly had been the Bronzino and the Bronzino
only Milly. "Superb, superb. Of course I had
noticed you. It is wonderful," she went on with her
back to the picture, but with some other eagerness
which Milly felt gathering, directing her motions
now. It was enough—they were introduced, and
she was saying "I wonder if you could give us the
pleasure of coming——" She was not fresh, for
she was not young, even though she denied at every
pore that she was old; but she was vivid and much
bejewelled for the midsummer daylight; and she
was all in the palest pinks and blues. She didn't
think, at this pass, that she could "come" anywhere—Milly
didn't; and she already knew that somehow
Lord Mark was saving her from the question. He
had interposed, taking the words out of the lady's
mouth and not caring at all if the lady minded. That
was clearly the right way to treat her—at least for
him; as she had only dropped, smiling, and then
turned away with him. She had been dealt with—it
would have done an enemy good. The gentleman
still stood, a little helpless, addressing himself to the
intention of urbanity as if it were a large loud
whistle; he had been signing sympathy, in his way,
while the lady made her overture; and Milly had,
in this light, soon arrived at their identity. They
were Lord and Lady Aldershaw, and the wife was
the clever one. A minute or two later the situation
had changed, and she knew it afterwards to have
been by the subtle operation of Kate. She was herself
saying that she was afraid she must go now if
Susie could be found; but she was sitting down on
the nearest seat to say it. The prospect, through
opened doors, stretched before her into other rooms,
down the vista of which Lord Mark was strolling
with Lady Aldershaw, who, close to him and much
intent, seemed to show from behind as peculiarly
expert. Lord Aldershaw, for his part, had been left
in the middle of the room, while Kate, with her back
to him, was standing before her with much sweetness
of manner. The sweetness was all for <i>her;</i> she had
the sense of the poor gentleman's having somehow
been handled as Lord Mark had handled his wife.
He dangled there, he shambled a little; then he bethought
himself of the Bronzino, before which, with
his eyeglass, he hovered. It drew from him an odd,
vague sound, not wholly distinct from a grunt, and
a "Humph—most remarkable!" which lighted
Kate's face with amusement. The next moment he
had creaked away, over polished floors, after the
others, and Milly was feeling as if <i>she</i> had been rude.
But Lord Aldershaw was in every way a detail, and
Kate was saying to her that she hoped she wasn't
ill.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Meanwhile, Lady Aldershaw was looking at Milly as if Milly *was* the famous Bronzino painting, and the painting was *just* Milly. "Wonderful, wonderful. Of course, I've noticed you. It's marvelous," she continued, with her back to the painting, but with a different kind of enthusiasm that Milly sensed was building and directing her actions. That was enough—they were introduced, and Lady Aldershaw was saying, "I wonder if you could join us—" She wasn't youthful, because she wasn't young, even though she clearly refused to admit she was old; but she was lively and heavily jeweled for the summer afternoon, and she was dressed entirely in pale pinks and blues. Milly didn't think she could "join" anything at this point; and she already knew that somehow Lord Mark was saving her from the invitation. He had interrupted, taking the words right out of Lady Aldershaw's mouth and not caring if she minded at all. That was obviously the best way to handle her—at least for him; she just smiled briefly and then walked away with him. She’d been dealt with, which would have pleased an enemy. The gentleman, Lord Aldershaw, still stood there, a bit lost, attempting to be polite as if it were a loud whistle; he had been silently expressing sympathy while his wife made her offer; and Milly had quickly figured out who they were. They were Lord and Lady Aldershaw, and the wife was the smart one. A few minutes later, the situation had changed, and she later realized it was because of Kate’s skillful intervention. Milly herself was saying she had to leave if she could find Susie; but she was still sitting down as she said it. The view through open doorways led to other rooms, and down the hallway, Lord Mark was strolling with Lady Aldershaw, who seemed to be very focused and from behind looked particularly experienced. Lord Aldershaw, meanwhile, had been left alone in the middle of the room, while Kate, facing Milly and with her back to him, was being very charming. All the charm was directed at Milly; she got the feeling that the poor gentleman had been handled in the same way Lord Mark had handled his wife. He just stood there, a little unsteady; then he remembered the Bronzino painting, which he then examined with his monocle. It caused him to make a strange, vague sound, not quite a grunt, and a "Humph—most remarkable!" which made Kate smile. The next moment, he had shuffled away, across the polished floors, after the others, and Milly felt like she had been impolite. But Lord Aldershaw was not important, and Kate was asking Milly if she felt alright.</i></p></div>

Thus it was that, aloft there in the great gilded
historic chamber and the presence of the pale personage
on the wall, whose eyes all the while seemed
engaged with her own, she found herself suddenly
sunk in something quite intimate and humble and to
which these grandeurs were strange enough witnesses.
It had come up, in the form in which she
had had to accept it, all suddenly, and nothing about
it, at the same time, was more marked than that she
had in a manner plunged into it to escape from something
else. Something else, from her first vision of
her friend's appearance three minutes before, had
been present to her even through the call made by
the others on her attention; something that was perversely
<i>there,</i> she was more and more uncomfortably
finding, at least for the first moments and by some
spring of its own, with every renewal of their meeting.
"Is it the way she looks to <i>him?"</i> she asked
herself—the perversity being that she kept in remembrance
that Kate was known to him. It wasn't
a fault in Kate—nor in him assuredly; and she had
a horror, being generous and tender, of treating
either of them as if it had been. To Densher himself
she couldn't make it up—he was too far away;
but her secondary impulse was to make it up to Kate.
She did so now with a strange soft energy—the impulse
immediately acting. "Will you render me
to-morrow a great service?"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>In that grand, ornate, historic room, with the portrait of the pale-faced man on the wall seemingly staring right at her, she suddenly felt a deep, personal emotion she hadn't expected. The opulence of the surroundings seemed a strange contrast to this feeling. It had hit her abruptly, in a form she had to accept, and it was clear that she'd embraced this feeling to escape something else. Ever since she'd seen her friend three minutes earlier, that "something else" had been there, even while others were demanding her attention. It was a disruptive presence, she realized with growing discomfort, especially during the initial moments and apparently operating on its own accord each time they met.</i></p><p><i>"Is this how he sees her?" she wondered, the disturbing fact being that she knew Kate was already familiar to him. It wasn't Kate's fault, and certainly not his; being kind and empathetic, she refused to treat either of them as if it were. She couldn't reason with Densher himself - he was too distant. But her immediate response was to make it up to Kate. She acted on this impulse with a strange, gentle intensity. "Will you do me a huge favor tomorrow?"</i></p></div>

"And for cheating," Kate asked, "my powers
will contribute? Well, I'll do my best for you." In
accordance with which it was presently settled between
them that Milly should have the aid and comfort
of her presence for a visit to Sir Luke Strett.
Kate had needed a minute for enlightenment, and it
was quite grand for her comrade that this name
should have said nothing to her. To Milly herself
it had for some days been secretly saying much. The
personage in question was, as she explained, the
greatest of medical lights if she had got hold, as
she believed (and she had used to this end the wisdom
of the serpent) of the right, the special man.
She had written to him three days before, and he
had named her an hour, eleven-twenty; only it had
come to her, on the eve, that she couldn't go alone.
Her maid, on the other hand, wasn't good enough,
and Susie was too good. Kate had listened, above
all, with high indulgence. "And I'm betwixt and
between, happy thought! Too good for what?"

As she explained, he was the most brilliant medical expert if she had found, as she believed (and she had cleverly used her cunning), the right, the perfect doctor. She had written to him three days earlier, and he had given her an appointment at eleven-twenty; but the day before, she'd realized she couldn't go alone.

Kate fixed her with deep eyes. "What in the
world is the matter with you?" It had inevitably
a sound of impatience, as if it had been a challenge
really to produce something; so that Milly felt her
for the moment only as a much older person, standing
above her a little, doubting the imagined ailments,
suspecting the easy complaints, of ignorant
youth. It somewhat checked her, further, that the
matter with her was what exactly as yet she wanted
knowledge about; and she immediately declared, for
conciliation, that if she were merely fanciful Kate
would see her put to shame. Kate vividly uttered,
in return, the hope that, since she could come out and
be so charming, could so universally dazzle and interest,
she wasn't all the while in distress or in anxiety—didn't
believe herself, in short, to be in any
degree seriously menaced. "Well, I want to make
out—to make out!" was all that this consistently
produced. To which Kate made clear answer:
"Ah then, let us by all means!"

This made Milly hesitate, because she didn't fully understand what was bothering her. She quickly tried to appease Kate by saying that if she was just imagining things, Kate would call her out on it. Kate responded eagerly, hoping that since Milly seemed so charming, captivating, and engaging, she wasn't actually suffering or worried, and that she wasn't seriously in trouble.

"Well, if I am, it must of course finally come out.
But I can go for a long time." Milly spoke with her
eyes again on her painted sister's—almost as if under
their suggestion. She still sat there before Kate, yet
not without a light in her face. "That will be one

It made a moment during which her companion
waited on her word; partly as if from a yearning,
shy but deep, to have her case put to her just as Kate
was struck by it; partly as if the hint of pity were
already giving a sense to her whimsical "shot," with
Lord Mark, at Mrs. Lowder's first dinner. Exactly
this—the handsome girl's compassionate manner,
her friendly descent from her own strength—was
what she had then foretold. She took Kate up as if
