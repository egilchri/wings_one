<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>A woman named Milly goes to the National Gallery. She walks through the rooms, watches lady-copyists, and then sits down to rest. While sitting, she observes other visitors, especially fellow Americans.</p><p>Three American women stop near her, looking at something behind her. One calls the object "handsome" and "in the English style," and then the three women leave. Milly gets up and turns around.</p><p>She sees a man, whom she recognizes as Merton Densher. She then sees that Kate Croy is with him. Kate sees Milly and smiles. Densher then notices Milly and greets her.</p><p>Milly invites Densher and Kate to lunch at her hotel, and they accept. They travel there in a four-wheeler cab. At the hotel, Milly's companion, Susie, is waiting with their meal. After lunch, Kate sits with Susie in one room, while Milly and Densher sit and talk in an adjacent room. Densher tells Milly about his recent trip to the United States.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
Milly is presented as a young woman in a fragile, "menaced state of health," seeking refuge from an overwhelming "personal question." She enters the National Gallery wanting cultural immersion but feels too weak for it, identifying instead with the anonymous, absorbed lives of the copyists.<p>Her situation shifts abruptly when she encounters Merton Densher and Kate Croy. This shock forces her out of her passive retreat and into a calculated social performance. She adopts a spontaneous, vivacious "American girl" persona as a defense mechanism to control the awkwardness and, more importantly, to delay confronting the ominous news she intuits awaits her from Sir Luke Strett.
</p><li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Presented through Milly’s eyes, Kate is a socially masterful and "prodigious person." Her first appearance is in a potentially compromising situation with Merton Densher.<p>Her situation immediately shifts from private outing to public encounter, a change she manages instantly and without words. With a single "far smile," she takes control, making the awkward meeting seem natural. Later, she strategically removes herself to sit with Susie, an action Milly interprets as a calculated maneuver to manage Densher.
</p><li>*Merton Densher**</li>
He is first presented as an object of others' observation: a "handsome" gentleman, preoccupied and unaware he is being watched.<p>His situation shifts from private contemplation to a startling social encounter. His reaction is a "vivid blush," a mix of embarrassment and pleasure. He quickly follows Kate's and Milly's lead, moving from initial confusion to adopting a safe, talkative role, which Milly perceives as him falling in line with the conventionally "kind" way everyone treats her.
</p><li>*Susie Shepherd**</li></ul>
Susie is presented as the silent keeper of a looming reality. Milly observes a "feverish glitter" in her eyes, indicating she holds the report from Sir Luke Strett. Her situation has changed off-page, and she now embodies the unspoken tension that Milly is actively trying to escape.

<p>
The idea of the National Gallery had been with
her from the moment of her hearing from Sir Luke
Strett about his hour of coming. It had been in her
mind as a place so meagrely visited, as one of the
places that had seemed at home one of the attractions
of Europe and one of its highest aids to culture, but
that—the old story—the typical frivolous always
ended by sacrificing to vulgar pleasures. She had
had perfectly, at those whimsical moments on the
Brünig, the half-shamed sense of turning her back
on such opportunities for real improvement as had
figured to her, from of old, in connection with the
continental tour, under the general head of "pictures
and things"; and now she knew for what she had
done so. The plea had been explicit—she had done
so for life, as opposed to learning; the upshot of
which had been that life was now beautifully provided
for. In spite of those few dips and dashes
into the many-coloured stream of history for which
of late Kate Croy had helped her to find time, there
were possible great chances she had neglected, possible
great moments she should, save for to-day, have
all but missed. She might still, she had felt, overtake
one or two of them among the Titians and the
Turners; she had been honestly nursing the hour,
and, once she was in the benignant halls, her faith
knew itself justified. It was the air she wanted and
the world she would now exclusively choose; the
quiet chambers, nobly overwhelming, rich but slightly
veiled, opened out round her and made her presently
say "If I could lose myself <i>here!"</i> There
were people, people in plenty, but, admirably, no personal
question. It was immense, outside, the personal
question; but she had blissfully left it outside,
and the nearest it came, for a quarter of an hour,
to glimmering again into sight was when she
watched for a little one of the more earnest of the
lady-copyists. Two or three in particular, spectacled,
aproned, absorbed, engaged her sympathy to
an absurd extent, seemed to show her for the time
the right way to live. She should have been a lady copyist—it
met so the case. The case was the case
of escape, of living under water, of being at once
impersonal and firm. There it was before one—one
had only to stick and stick.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She'd been thinking about the National Gallery since Sir Luke Strett told her when he'd be arriving. She pictured it as a place that wasn't visited very often, even though it was one of those things that made Europe so appealing, one of its cultural high points. But, like always, people ended up choosing shallow fun over more meaningful pursuits. She'd felt ashamed of herself sometimes, like when she was on the Brünig, for turning away from the chance to improve herself, which she'd always associated with her European travels and "art and culture." Now she understood why she'd done it. The reason was clear—she'd chosen life over learning, and as a result, life was now comfortable and secure. Despite the few attempts she'd made recently, thanks to Kate Croy, to delve into the fascinating world of history, she'd missed out on some amazing experiences, some great moments that, except for today, she would have missed completely. She still hoped to catch up with some of them among the Titians and Turners. She'd been eagerly anticipating this visit, and now, in the welcoming galleries, she felt her expectations were justified. This was the atmosphere she craved, the world she wanted to be in: those calm, grand rooms, rich but slightly subdued, surrounded her and made her think, "If only I could just disappear here!" There were plenty of people, but thankfully, no personal drama. Outside, personal issues were everywhere, but she'd happily left them behind. The closest they came to resurfacing was when she watched a few of the more dedicated female copyists. She felt absurdly connected to a couple of them in particular, who were wearing glasses and aprons, and were completely focused on their work; for a little while, they seemed to show her the right way to live. She should have been a lady copyist—it suited her situation perfectly. Her situation was about escape, about living beneath the surface, about being both anonymous and resolute. The opportunity was right there—she just had to commit and persevere.</i></p></div>

<p>
Milly yielded to this charm till she was almost
ashamed; she watched the lady-copyists till she
found herself wondering what would be thought by
others of a young woman, of adequate aspect, who
should appear to regard them as the pride of the
place. She would have liked to talk to them, to get,
as it figured to her, into their lives, and was deterred
but by the fact that she didn't quite see herself as
purchasing imitations and yet feared she might excite
the expectation of purchase. She really knew
before long that what held her was the mere refuge,
that something within her was after all too weak
for the Turners and Titians. They joined hands
about her in a circle too vast, though a circle that a
year before she would only have desired to trace.
They were truly for the larger, not for the smaller
life, the life of which the actual pitch, for example,
was an interest, the interest of compassion, in misguided
efforts. She marked absurdly her little stations,
blinking, in her shrinkage of curiosity, at the
glorious walls, yet keeping an eye on vistas and approaches,
so that she shouldn't be flagrantly caught.
The vistas and approaches drew her in this way from
room to room, and she had been through many parts
of the show, as she supposed, when she sat down to
rest. There were chairs in scant clusters, places
from which one could gaze. Milly indeed at present
fixed her eyes more than elsewhere on the appearance,
first, that she couldn't quite, after all, have accounted
to an examiner for the order of her
"schools," and then on that of her being more tired
than she had meant, in spite of her having been so
much less intelligent. They found, her eyes, it
should be added, other occupation as well, which she
let them freely follow: they rested largely, in her
vagueness, on the vagueness of other visitors; they
attached themselves in especial, with mixed results,
to the surprising stream of her compatriots. She
was struck with the circumstance that the great
museum, early in August, was haunted with these
pilgrims, as also with that of her knowing them from
afar, marking them easily, each and all, and recognising
not less promptly that they had ever new
lights for her—new lights on their own darkness.
She gave herself up at last, and it was a consummation
like another: what she should have come to the
National Gallery for to-day would be to watch the
copyists and reckon the Baedekers. That perhaps
was the moral of a menaced state of health—that one
would sit in public places and count the Americans.
It passed the time in a manner; but it seemed already
the second line of defence, and this notwithstanding
the pattern, so unmistakable, of her country-folk.
They were cut out as by scissors, coloured, labelled,
mounted; but their relation to her failed to act—they
somehow did nothing for her. Partly, no
doubt, they didn't so much as notice or know her,
didn't even recognise their community of collapse
with her, the sign on her, as she sat there, that for
her too Europe was "tough." It came to her idly
thus—for her humour could still play—that she
didn't seem then the same success with them as with
the inhabitants of London, who had taken her up on
scarce more of an acquaintance. She could wonder
if they would be different should she go back with
that glamour attached; and she could also wonder,
if it came to that, whether she should ever go back.
Her friends straggled past, at any rate, in all the
vividness of their absent criticism, and she had even
at last the sense of taking a mean advantage.
There was a finer instant, however, at which three
ladies, clearly a mother and daughters, had paused
before her under compulsion of a comment apparently
just uttered by one of them and referring to
some object on the other side of the room. Milly
had her back to the object, but her face very much
to her young compatriot, the one who had spoken
and in whose look she perceived a certain gloom of
recognition. Recognition, for that matter, sat confessedly
in her own eyes: she <i>knew</i> the three, generically,
as easily as a schoolboy with a crib in his lap
would know the answer in class; she felt, like the
schoolboy, guilty enough—questioned, as honour
went, as to her right so to possess, to dispossess, people
who hadn't consciously provoked her. She
would have been able to say where they lived, and
how, had the place and the way been but amenable
to the positive; she bent tenderly, in imagination,
over marital, paternal Mr. Whatever-he-was, at
home, eternally named, with all the honours and
placidities, but eternally unseen and existing only
as some one who could be financially heard from.
The mother, the puffed and composed whiteness of
whose hair had no relation to her apparent age,
showed a countenance almost chemically clean and
dry; her companions wore an air of vague resentment
humanised by fatigue; and the three were
equally adorned with short cloaks of coloured cloth
surmounted by little tartan hoods. The tartans
were doubtless conceivable as different, but the
cloaks, curiously, only thinkable as one. "Handsome?
Well, if you choose to say so." It was the
mother who had spoken, who herself added, after a
pause during which Milly took the reference as to a
picture: "In the English style." The three pair
of eyes had converged, and their possessors had for
an instant rested, with the effect of a drop of the
subject, on this last characterisation—with that, too,
of a gloom not less mute in one of the daughters than
murmured in the other. Milly's heart went out to
them while they turned their backs; she said to herself
that they ought to have known her, that there
was something between them they might have beautifully
put together. But she had lost <i>them</i> also—they
were cold; they left her in her weak wonder
as to what they had been looking at. The "handsome"
disposed her to turn—all the more that the
"English style" would be the English school, which
she liked; only she saw, before moving, by the array
on the side facing her, that she was in fact among
small Dutch pictures. The action of this was again
appreciable—the dim surmise that it wouldn't then
be by a picture that the spring in the three ladies had
been pressed. It was at all events time she should
go, and she turned as she got on her feet. She had
had behind her one of the entrances and various visitors
who had come in while she sat, visitors single
and in pairs—by one of the former of whom she felt
her eyes suddenly held.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly was drawn to these artists, almost to the point of embarrassment. She watched the women copying the paintings and found herself wondering what people would think of a young woman who seemed to admire them so much. She wanted to talk to them, to understand their lives, but she hesitated because she didn't want to buy their imitations, fearing she might encourage them to expect a purchase. She soon realized that what was keeping her there was the simple comfort it offered. She felt too insecure for the great masters, like the Turners and Titians. These artists represented a world she couldn't fully access, a world that was too big for her. A year ago she would have longed to be part of that circle. They represented the larger, not the smaller life – a life in which the actual focus was compassion for misguided efforts. She was embarrassed by her small-mindedness, but kept glancing at the glorious paintings while keeping an eye out for interesting people, so she wouldn’t be caught gawking.</i></p><p><i>These people drew her from room to room. She had been through a good part of the museum before she sat down to rest. There were a few chairs grouped together, places where you could sit and look. Milly was particularly focused on two things: first, that she couldn't explain the order of the schools of art to an examiner; and second, that she was more tired than she had expected to be, despite not being as engaged with the art as she could have been.</i></p><p><i>She found herself, almost idly, observing the other visitors. She focused on the vague expressions of the other people, especially the surprisingly large number of her American compatriots. She was struck by how many tourists visited the museum in early August, and how easily she recognized them and realized they always offered her new perspectives – new insights into their own difficulties.</i></p><p><i>She finally gave in, and it felt like a final thing: that her purpose at the National Gallery that day was to watch the copyists and count the guidebooks. Perhaps that was the result of her poor health: she’d sit in public and count the Americans. It passed the time. But it felt like a second line of defense, despite the obvious stereotypes of her fellow countrymen. They were like cut-outs, color-coded and labeled, but she couldn't connect with them. They didn't seem to notice her or recognize that they were in the same predicament. Sitting there, she felt that for her too, Europe was "tough." It occurred to her, with a hint of humor, that she wasn't as successful with them as she was with the Londoners, who had welcomed her with little more than a casual acquaintance. She wondered if things would be different if she went back with some of that social prestige, and also wondered if she would ever go back.</i></p><p><i>Her friends, in all their absent criticism, drifted by.

Milly knew the three, generically, as a schoolboy knows the answer to a test. She felt guilty, wondering whether it was fair for her to judge people who hadn't consciously provoked her. She could have described where and how they lived, if only the situation would allow it. She imagined the husband, the father, at home, always being talked about but never seen, existing only as someone who could be counted on financially.</i></p><p><i>The mother, whose hair was perfectly white and meticulously styled, showed a blank expression. Her companions looked vaguely resentful but tired. They all wore short cloaks and tartan hoods. The tartans might have been different, but the cloaks were remarkably alike.</i></p><p><i>"Handsome? If you choose to say so," the mother said. After a pause, during which Milly assumed they were referring to a painting, the mother added, "In the English style." The three pairs of eyes had focused on this last comment and then, as if dismissing it, looked back at the painting, with the suggestion of gloom. Milly's heart went out to them. They were like cold strangers. She felt that they should have known her. She thought that they might have had something in common. But she had lost them. They left her wondering what they had been looking at.</i></p><p><i>The word "handsome" made her want to turn around – especially since "English style" meant the English school, which she liked.

This was a gentleman in the middle of the place,
a gentleman who had removed his hat and was for a
moment, while he glanced, absently, as she could see,
at the top tier of the collection, tapping his forehead
with his pocket-handkerchief. The occupation held
him long enough to give Milly time to take for
granted—and a few seconds sufficed—that his face
was the object just observed by her friends. This
could only have been because she concurred in their
tribute, even qualified, and indeed "the English
style" of the gentleman—perhaps by instant contrast
to the American—was what had had the arresting
power. This arresting power, at the same time—and
that was the marvel—had already sharpened
almost to pain, for in the very act of judging the
bared head with detachment she felt herself shaken
by a knowledge of it. It was Merton Densher's
own, and he was standing there, standing long
enough unconscious for her to fix him and then hesitate.
These successions were swift, so that she
could still ask herself in freedom if she had best let
him see her. She could still reply to that that she
shouldn't like him to catch her in the effort to prevent
this; and she might further have decided that
he was too preoccupied to see anything had not a
perception intervened that surpassed the first in violence.
She was unable to think afterwards how long
she had looked at him before knowing herself as
otherwise looked at; all she was coherently to put together
was that she had had a second recognition
without his having noticed her. The source of this
latter shock was nobody less than Kate Croy—Kate
Croy who was suddenly also in the line of vision and
whose eyes met her eyes at their next movement.
Kate was but two yards off—Mr. Densher wasn't
alone. Kate's face specifically said so, for after a
stare as blank at first as Milly's it broke into a far
smile. That was what, wonderfully—in addition to
the marvel of their meeting—passed from her for
Milly; the instant reduction to easy terms of the fact
of their being there, the two young women, together.
It was perhaps only afterwards that the girl fully
felt the connection between this touch and her already
established conviction that Kate was a prodigious
person; yet on the spot she none the less, in a
degree, knew herself handled and again, as she had
been the night before, dealt with—absolutely even
dealt with for her greater pleasure. A minute in
fine hadn't elapsed before Kate had somehow made
her provisionally take everything as natural. The
provisional was just the charm—acquiring that character
from one moment to the other; it represented
happily so much that Kate would explain on the very
first chance. This left moreover—and that was the
greatest wonder—all due margin for amusement at
the way things happened, the monstrous oddity of
their turning up in such a place on the very heels of
their having separated without allusion to it. The
handsome girl was thus literally in control of the
scene by the time Merton Densher was ready to exclaim
with a high flush, or a vivid blush—one didn't
distinguish the embarrassment from the joy—"Why,
Miss Theale: fancy!" and "Why, Miss
Theale: what luck!"

Miss Theale had meanwhile the sense that for him
too, on Kate's part, something wonderful and unspoken
was determinant; and this although, distinctly,
his companion had no more looked at him with a
hint than he had looked at her with a question. He
had looked and he was looking only at Milly herself,
ever so pleasantly and considerately—she scarce
knew what to call it; but without prejudice to her
consciousness, all the same, that women got out of
predicaments better than men. The predicament of
course wasn't definite or phraseable—and the way
they let all phrasing pass was presently to recur to
our young woman as a characteristic triumph of the
civilised state; but she took it for granted, insistently,
with a small private flare of passion, because
the one thing she could think of to do for him was
to show him how she eased him off. She would
really, tired and nervous, have been much disconcerted,
were it not that the opportunity in question
had saved her. It was what had saved her most,
what had made her, after the first few seconds,
almost as brave for Kate as Kate was for her, had
made her only ask herself what their friend would
like of her. That he was at the end of three minutes,
without the least complicated reference, so
smoothly "their" friend was just the effect of their
all being sublimely civilised. The flash in which he
saw this was, for Milly, fairly inspiring—to that
degree in fact that she was even now, on such a
plane, yearning to be supreme. It took, no doubt,
a big dose of inspiration to treat as not funny—or
at least as not unpleasant—the anomaly, for Kate,
that <i>she</i> knew their gentleman, and for herself, that
Kate was spending the morning with him; but
everything continued to make for this after Milly
had tasted of her draught. She was to wonder in
subsequent reflection what in the world they had
actually said, since they had made such a success of
what they didn't say; the sweetness of the draught
for the time, at any rate, was to feel success assured.
What depended on this for Mr. Densher was all obscurity
to her, and she perhaps but invented the
image of his need as a short cut to service. Whatever
were the facts, their perfect manners, all round,
saw them through. The finest part of Milly's own
inspiration, it may further be mentioned, was the
quick perception that what would be of most service
was, so to speak, her own native wood-note. She
had long been conscious with shame for her thin
blood, or at least for her poor economy, of her unused
margin as an American girl—closely indeed as,
in English air, the text might appear to cover the
page. She still had reserves of spontaneity, if not
of comicality; so that all this cash in hand could now
find employment. She became as spontaneous as
possible and as American as it might conveniently
appeal to Mr. Densher, after his travels, to find her.
She said things in the air, and yet flattered herself
that she struck him as saying them not in the tone
of agitation but in the tone of New York. In the
tone of New York agitation was beautifully discounted,
and she had now a sufficient view of how
much it might accordingly help her.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Meanwhile, Miss Theale felt that something wonderful and unspoken, related to Kate, was also important to him. Even though, clearly, Kate hadn't given him any hints, just as he hadn't asked her any questions. He was only looking at Milly, very pleasantly and thoughtfully—she wasn't sure what to call it. But she still knew, despite that, that women were better at navigating tricky situations than men. The situation wasn't clear or easily described—and the way they avoided any explanation would later strike her as a characteristic success of polite society. She believed this intensely, with a private burst of feeling, because the only thing she could think to do for him was to show him how she could make things easier for him. She was tired and nervous, and would have been very upset, if this opportunity hadn't saved her. It had saved her, more than anything, making her, after the first few seconds, almost as brave for Kate as Kate was for her. It made her only wonder what their friend would want from her. The fact that he was, within three minutes, smoothly referred to as "their" friend, without any complications, was simply a result of them all being incredibly polite. The sudden realization of this was, for Milly, quite inspiring—so much so that she now, at that moment, wanted to be in control. It probably took a lot of inspiration to treat the fact that Kate knew their gentleman, and that Kate was spending the morning with him, as not funny—or at least, not unpleasant. But everything kept moving in this direction after Milly had taken her cue. She would later wonder what they had actually said, since they'd been so successful at what they hadn't said. For the time being, the positive outcome felt certain. What depended on this for Mr. Densher was completely unclear to her, and perhaps she just imagined his need as a quick way to be helpful. Whatever the facts, their perfect manners, all around, got them through. The best part of Milly's inspiration, it should be added, was the quick understanding that what would be most helpful was, so to speak, her own natural voice. She had long been ashamed of her perceived lack of depth, or at least her poor self-control, of her unused potential as an American girl—even though, in an English setting, it might seem like the rules covered everything. She still had reserves of spontaneity, if not of humor; so that this available resource could now be put to use. She became as spontaneous as possible and as American as she thought would appeal to Mr. Densher, after his travels. She made casual remarks, but she flattered herself that she sounded to him not agitated, but like someone from New York. In the tone of New York, anxiety was easily dismissed, and she now understood how much that could help her.</i></p></div>

The help was fairly rendered before they left the
place; when her friends presently accepted her invitation
to adjourn with her to luncheon at her hotel,
it was in the Fifth Avenue that the meal might have
waited. Kate had never been there so straight, but
Milly was at present taking her; and if Mr. Densher
had been he had at least never had to come so fast.
She proposed it as the natural thing—proposed it
as the American girl; and she saw herself quickly
justified by the pace at which she was followed.
The beauty of the case was that to do it all she had
only to appear to take Kate's hint. This had said,
in its fine first smile, "Oh yes, our look is queer—but
give me time;" and the American girl could give
time as nobody else could. What Milly thus gave
she therefore made them take—even if, as they
might surmise, it was rather more than they wanted.
In the porch of the museum she expressed her preference
for a four-wheeler; they would take their
course in that guise precisely to multiply the minutes.
She was more than ever justified by the positive
charm that her spirit imparted even to their use of
this conveyance; and she touched her highest point—that
is, certainly, for herself—as she ushered her
companions into the presence of Susie. Susie was
there with luncheon, with her return, in prospect;
and nothing could now have filled her own consciousness
more to the brim than to see this good friend
take in how little she was abjectly anxious. The
cup itself actually offered to this good friend might
in truth well be startling, for it was composed beyond
question of ingredients oddly mixed. She caught
Susie fairly looking at her as if to know whether
she had brought in guests to hear Sir Luke Strett's
report. Well, it was better her companion should
have too much than too little to wonder about; she
had come out "anyway," as they said at home, for
the interest of the thing; and interest truly sat in
her eyes. Milly was none the less, at the sharpest
crisis, a little sorry for her; she could of necessity
extract from the odd scene so comparatively little of
a soothing secret. She saw Mr. Densher suddenly
popping up, but she saw nothing else that had happened.
She saw in the same way her young friend
indifferent to her young friend's doom, and she
lacked what would explain it. The only thing to
keep her in patience was the way, after luncheon,
Kate almost, as might be said, made up to her. This
was actually perhaps as well what most kept Milly
herself in patience. It had in fact for our young
woman a positive beauty—was so marked as a deviation
from the handsome girl's previous courses.
Susie had been a bore to the handsome girl, and the
change was now suggestive. The two sat together,
after they had risen from table, in the apartment in
which they had lunched, making it thus easy for the
other guest and his entertainer to sit in the room adjacent.
This, for the latter personage, was the
beauty; it was almost, on Kate's part, like a prayer
to be relieved. If she honestly liked better to be
"thrown with" Susan Shepherd than with their
other friend, why that said practically everything.
It didn't perhaps altogether say why she had gone
out with him for the morning, but it said, as one
thought, about as much as she could say to his face.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The help was provided before they left the museum. When her friends immediately accepted her invitation to go with her to lunch at her hotel, which was on Fifth Avenue, the meal was likely waiting for them. Kate had never been there so directly, but Milly was currently taking her. And if Mr. Densher had been, he had at least never had to rush so quickly. She suggested it as a natural thing—like the American girl that she was—and she quickly saw her decision validated by how quickly they followed her. The best part of it was that she only had to appear to be taking Kate's suggestion. Kate’s initial welcoming smile had said, "Yes, our situation is strange—but give me time"; and the American girl was patient in a way nobody else could be. Therefore, whatever Milly offered, she made them accept—even if they suspected they were getting more than they wanted. In the museum's entrance, she chose a horse-drawn carriage; they would use it to deliberately extend their time together. She was even more justified by the positive charm her spirit brought to their ride. And she reached her peak—at least, for herself—when she introduced her companions to Susie. Susie was there with lunch, with her return in mind; and nothing could have filled Milly's own thoughts more completely than seeing her good friend understand how little she was actually worried. The experience offered to this good friend might indeed be shocking, because it was made up of unusual and mixed elements. She noticed Susie looking at her, as if wondering if she had brought guests to hear Sir Luke Strett's report. Well, it was better that her friend should have too much rather than too little to wonder about. She had come out, “anyway,” as they said at home, for the excitement of it; and excitement was clear in her eyes. Milly was, nonetheless, at the most critical moment, a little sorry for her; she could get so little comfort or understanding from the strange scene. She saw Mr. Densher suddenly appear, but she saw nothing else that was happening. She also saw that her young friend was indifferent to her young friend's fate, and she couldn't understand it. The only thing that kept her patient was the way, after lunch, Kate almost made up to her. This was perhaps also what kept Milly herself patient. It actually had a beauty for our young woman—it was so clear as a change from the beautiful girl's previous behavior. Susie had been a nuisance to the beautiful girl, and the change was now meaningful. The two of them sat together, after they had finished eating, in the room where they had lunched, making it easy for the other guest and his host to sit in the next room. For Kate, this was the best part; it was almost like a plea for relief. If she honestly preferred spending time with Susan Shepherd rather than their other friend, that practically said everything. It didn't fully explain why she had gone out with him for the morning, but it said, as one might think, about as much as she could say to his face.</i></p></div>

Little by little indeed, under the vividness of
Kate's behaviour, the probabilities fell back into
their order. Merton Densher was in love, and Kate
couldn't help it—could only be sorry and kind:
wouldn't that, without wild flurries, cover everything?
Milly at all events tried it as a cover, tried
it hard, for the time; pulled it over her, in the front,
the larger room, drew it up to her chin with energy.
If it didn't, so treated, do everything for her, it did
so much that she could herself supply the rest. She
made that up by the interest of her great question,
the question of whether, seeing him once more, with
all that, as she called it to herself, had come and
gone, her impression of him would be different from
the impression received in New York. That had
held her from the moment of their leaving the
museum; it kept her company through their drive
and during luncheon; and now that she was a quarter
of an hour alone with him it became acute. She
was to feel at this crisis that no clear, no common
answer, no direct satisfaction on this point, was
to reach her; she was to see her question itself simply
go to pieces. She couldn't tell if he were different
or not, and she didn't know nor care if <i>she</i> were:
these things had ceased to matter in the light of the
only thing she did know. This was that she liked
him, as she put it to herself, as much as ever; and
if that were to amount to liking a new person the
amusement would be but the greater. She had
thought him at first very quiet, in spite of recovery
from his original confusion; though even the shade
of bewilderment, she yet perceived, had not been due
to such vagueness on the subject of her reintensified
identity as the probable sight, over there, of many
thousands of her kind would sufficiently have justified.
No, he was quiet, inevitably, for the first half
of the time, because Milly's own lively line—the line
of spontaneity—made everything else relative; and
because too, so far as Kate was spontaneous, it was
ever so finely in the air among them that the normal
pitch must be kept. Afterwards, when they had got
a little more used, as it were, to each other's separate
felicity, he had begun to talk more, clearly bethought
himself, at a given moment, of what <i>his</i> natural lively
line would be. It would be to take for granted
she must wish to hear of the States, and to give her,
in its order, everything he had seen and done there.
He abounded, of a sudden he almost insisted; he
returned, after breaks, to the charge; and the effect
was perhaps the more odd as he gave no clue whatever
to what he had admired, as he went, or to what
he hadn't. He simply drenched her with his sociable
story—especially during the time they were away
from the others. She had stopped then being American—all
to let him be English; a permission of
which he took, she could feel, both immense and unconscious
advantage. She had really never cared
less for the "States" than at this moment; but that
had nothing to do with the matter. It would have
been the occasion of her life to learn about them, for
nothing could put him off, and he ventured on no
reference to what had happened for herself. It
might have been almost as if he had known that the
greatest of all these adventures was her doing just
what she did then.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Gradually, as Kate's behavior became more obvious, the situation unfolded as expected. Merton Densher was in love, and Kate couldn't prevent it—she could only be regretful and kind. Wouldn't that, without causing a scene, resolve everything? At any rate, Milly tried to use that as a cover, tried hard to accept it for the time being. She embraced it, both literally and figuratively. She found comfort in it. If it didn't solve everything, it did so much that she could fill in the gaps herself. She did this by focusing on her central question: whether, seeing him again, considering everything that had happened, her opinion of him would be different from the impression she'd had in New York. That thought had occupied her from the moment they left the museum. It stayed with her during their drive and lunch. Now that she was alone with him for fifteen minutes, the question became intense. At this moment, she felt she wouldn't get a clear, straightforward answer, or any direct satisfaction. Her question itself seemed to be crumbling. She couldn't tell if he was different or not, and she didn't know or care if she herself was. These things were no longer important, because she knew only one thing: she liked him, as much as ever. If that meant she was liking a new person, it would only make it more interesting. She had initially thought him very reserved, even though he had recovered from his initial confusion. She realized that his slight bewilderment hadn't been caused by the idea of her returning, even though the sight of thousands of similar women would probably have justified it. No, he was quiet, inevitably, at first, because Milly's own outgoing personality made everything else seem less significant. Also, as far as Kate was spontaneous, it was always implied between them that they had to maintain a certain level of decorum. Later, when they had gotten a little more comfortable with each other's happiness, he began to talk more, clearly deciding, at a given moment, what his natural and lively conversation style would be. He would assume she wanted to hear about America and would tell her, in order, everything he had seen and done there. He suddenly talked a lot, even insisted at times. He kept returning to the subject after pauses. This was perhaps even stranger because he never gave any hint of what he had liked or disliked while he was there. He simply bombarded her with his social stories, especially when they were away from the others. She stopped being American then—all to let him be English. She could feel that he took both enormous and unconscious advantage of this. She had never cared less about "America" than at that moment, but that wasn't the point. It would have been the perfect opportunity to learn about it, because nothing could stop him from talking, and he never mentioned what had happened to her. It was almost as if he knew that the greatest adventure of all was her doing exactly what she was doing then.</i></p></div>

It was at this point that she saw the smash of her
great question as complete, saw that all she had to
do with was the sense of being there with him. And
there was no chill for this in what she also presently
saw—that, however he had begun, he was now acting
from a particular desire, determined either by
new facts or new fancies, to be like everyone else,
simplifyingly "kind" to her. He had caught on
already as to manner—fallen into line with everyone
else; and if his spirits verily <i>had</i> gone up it might
well be that he had thus felt himself lighting on the
remedy for all awkwardness. Whatever he did or
he didn't, Milly knew she should still like him—there
was no alternative to that; but her heart could none
the less sink a little on feeling how much his view
of her was destined to have in common with—as she
now sighed over it—<i>the</i> view. She could have
dreamed of his not having <i>the</i> view, of his having
something or other, if need be quite viewless, of his
own; but he might have what he could with least
trouble, and <i>the</i> view wouldn't be, after all, a positive
bar to her seeing him. The defect of it in general—if
she might so ungraciously criticise—was that, by
its sweet universality, it made relations rather prosaically
a matter of course. It anticipated and superseded
the—likewise sweet—operation of real
affinities. It was this that was doubtless marked in
her power to keep him now—this and her glassy lustre
of attention to his pleasantness about the scenery
in the Rockies. She was in truth a little measuring
her success in detaining him by Kate's success in
"standing" Susan. It would not be, if she could
help it, Mr. Densher who should first break down.
Such at least was one of the forms of the girl's inward
tension; but beneath even this deep reason was
a motive still finer. What she had left at home on
going out to give it a chance was meanwhile still,
was more sharply and actively, there. What had
been at the top of her mind about it and then been
violently pushed down—this quantity was again
working up. As soon as their friends should go
Susie would break out, and what she would break
out upon wouldn't be—interested in that gentleman
as she had more than once shown herself—the personal
fact of Mr. Densher. Milly had found in her
face at luncheon a feverish glitter, and it told what
she was full of. She didn't care now for Mr. Densher's
personal fact. Mr. Densher had risen before
her only to find his proper place in her imagination
already, of a sudden, occupied. His personal fact
failed, so far as she was concerned, to be personal,
and her companion noted the failure. This could
only mean that she was full to the brim, of Sir Luke
Strett, and of what she had had from him. What
<i>had</i> she had from him? It was indeed now working
upward again that Milly would do well to know,
though knowledge looked stiff in the light of Susie's
glitter. It was therefore, on the whole, because
Densher's young hostess was divided from it by so
thin a partition that she continued to cling to the
Rockies.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>That’s when she understood the full impact of her big question. She realized the only thing she needed to focus on was the feeling of being with him. And there was no disappointment in what she also realized: regardless of how he’d started, he was now acting out of a specific desire, possibly driven by new information or new fantasies, to be like everyone else, and be simplistically "kind" to her. He’d already learned how to behave, fitting in with everyone else; and if his mood had genuinely improved, it could very well be that he thought he’d found the solution to any awkwardness. Whatever he did or didn’t do, Milly knew she would still like him – there was no other choice; but her heart still sank a little when she felt how much his perception of her would align with—as she now sighed over—the prevailing view. She could have hoped he wouldn't have that view, that he’d have something unique of his own, even if it wasn't a view at all. But he might as well take the path of least resistance, and the view wouldn't entirely prevent her from seeing him. The flaw in the general situation - if she could be so critical – was that its sweet universality made their relationship rather ordinary. It pre-empted and replaced the—equally nice—workings of genuine connection. That was undoubtedly the factor in her ability to keep him there now, along with her perfectly attentive focus on his pleasant comments about the scenery in the Rockies. She was, in truth, subtly measuring her success in keeping him by Kate’s success in “handling” Susan. It wouldn’t be, if she could help it, Mr. Densher who would be the first to leave. This was at least one of the ways the girl was feeling the pressure internally; but beneath this more obvious reason was a more nuanced motivation. What she had left at home when she had gone out to give it a chance, was still there, and now more intensely present. The thing she'd been thinking most about, that she’d then pushed down, was now rising back up. As soon as their friends left, Susie would explode, and what she would explode about wouldn’t be – despite having shown interest in the man more than once – the personal fact of Mr. Densher. Milly had seen a feverish excitement in her face at lunch, and it revealed what she was preoccupied with. She didn’t care now about Mr. Densher’s personal reality. Mr. Densher had appeared before her only to find his proper place in her imagination already, suddenly, occupied. His personal reality, as far as she was concerned, had become irrelevant, and her companion noticed the irrelevance. This could only mean that she was overflowing with thoughts of Sir Luke Strett, and what she’d gotten from him. What had she gotten from him? It was now beginning to dawn on Milly that it would be wise to know, though knowledge felt rigid in the face of Susie’s excitement. Therefore, all things considered, because Densher’s young hostess was separated from the truth by only a thin barrier, she continued to cling to the Rockies.</i></p></div>
