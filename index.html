                <div class="calibre7">Following a lengthy court case, an appeals court confirms a ruling that assigns custody of a child to her father, Beale Farange. The court also orders the father to refund £2,600 to his ex-wife, Ida. The father is unable to produce the money. After another dispute, their lawyers propose a compromise that both sides accept. The father's debt is forgiven, and the parents agree to a new custody arrangement. The child will live with each parent for six months at a time, in rotation. A female relative of the mother then offers to take the child herself, but the mother rejects the offer. It is noted that the child has her own income from a trust fund left by the father's deceased aunt. The Faranges' friends gather and argue about the couple and their situation.</div>

            <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">The litigation seemed interminable and had in fact been complicated; but by the decision on the appeal the judgement of the divorce-court was confirmed as to the assignment of the child. The father, who, though bespattered from head to foot, had made good his case, was, in pursuance of this triumph, appointed to keep her: it was not so much that the mother's character had been more absolutely damaged as that the brilliancy of a lady's complexion (and this lady's, in court, was immensely remarked) might be more regarded as showing the spots. Attached, however, to the second pronouncement was a condition that detracted, for Beale Farange, from its sweetness&mdash;an order that he should refund to his late wife the twenty-six hundred pounds put down by her, as it was called, some three years before, in the interest of the child's maintenance and precisely on a proved understanding that he would take no proceedings: a sum of which he had had the administration and of which he could render not the least account. The obligation thus attributed to her adversary was no small balm to Ida's resentment; it drew a part of the sting from her defeat and compelled Mr.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">The legal proceedings dragged on endlessly and had, in reality, been quite complex. However, the appellate court's decision upheld the divorce court's ruling regarding custody of the child. The father, though thoroughly smeared, had ultimately prevailed and, as a consequence of his victory, was granted custody. It wasn't that the mother's reputation was more severely tarnished, but rather that a woman's attractiveness&mdash;and this particular woman's appearance in court was widely discussed&mdash;could be seen as revealing her flaws. Nevertheless, this second ruling included a condition that lessened the victory's impact for Beale Farange: an order to reimburse his ex-wife the twenty-six hundred pounds she had provided, approximately three years earlier, for the child's care, with the explicit understanding that he wouldn't pursue legal action. He had managed the money but couldn't provide any accounting for it. This obligation placed on her opponent somewhat eased Ida's bitterness; it softened the blow of her loss and forced Mr.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">Farange perceptibly to lower his crest. He was unable to produce the money or to raise it in any way; so that after a squabble scarcely less public and scarcely more decent than the original shock of battle his only issue from his predicament was a compromise proposed by his legal advisers and finally accepted by hers. His debt was by this arrangement remitted to him and the little girl disposed of in a manner worthy of the judgement-seat of Solomon. She was divided in two and the portions tossed impartially to the disputants.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">Farange visibly deflated. He couldn't produce the money, nor could he find a way to get it. So, after a dispute that was almost as public and just as unsavory as the original battle, his only escape from the situation was a compromise suggested by his own lawyers and eventually agreed to by hers. Through this arrangement, his debt was forgiven, and the little girl was dealt with in a way that would have done justice to the judgment of Solomon. She was divided in two, and the portions were handed out impartially to the litigants.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">They would take her, in rotation, for six months at a time; she would spend half the year with each. This was odd justice in the eyes of those who still blinked in the fierce light projected from the tribunal&mdash;a light in which neither parent figured in the least as a happy example to youth and innocence. What was to have been expected on the evidence was the nomination, in loco parentis, of some proper third person, some respectable or at least some presentable friend. Apparently, however, the circle of the Faranges had been scanned in vain for any such ornament; so that the only solution finally meeting all the difficulties was, save that of sending Maisie to a Home, the partition of the tutelary office in the manner I have mentioned.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">They would have her in rotation, spending six months with each parent. Half the year with one, half with the other. Those still struggling to adjust to the intense scrutiny of the court found this a strange form of justice. Neither parent was a good role model for a child. Based on the evidence, the expectation was that the court would appoint a suitable third party, a respectable friend, to act in place of the parents. However, the Farange family's social circle contained no such person. Barring the option of placing Maisie in an institution, the only way to resolve the situation was to divide parental responsibility, as I have described.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">There were more reasons for her parents to agree to it than there had ever been for them to agree to anything; and they now prepared with her help to enjoy the distinction that waits upon vulgarity sufficiently attested. Their rupture had resounded, and after being perfectly insignificant together they would be decidedly striking apart. Had they not produced an impression that warranted people in looking for appeals in the newspapers for the rescue of the little one&mdash;reverberation, amid a vociferous public, of the idea that some movement should be started or some benevolent person should come forward?

Their split had been dramatic, and after being utterly unremarkable together, they would be undeniably noticeable apart. Hadn't they made such an impression that people expected to see pleas in the newspapers for the little one's rescue&mdash;the echo, among a clamoring public, of an idea that some initiative should be launched or some charitable soul should step forward?

This would make every time, for Maisie, after her inevitable six months with Beale, much more of a change. "More of a change?" Ida cried. "Won't it be enough of a change for her to come from that low brute to the person in the world who detests him most?"</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">Farange, to whom she suggested that, since children and their nurseries were established and functioning, she ought to be permitted to take the core issue and, by integrating it into her own life, alleviate at least one parent's burden.

The good lady, for a moment, made no reply: her silence was a grim judgement of the whole point of view.

They had wanted her not for any good they could do her, but for the harm they could, with her unconscious aid, do each other. She should serve their anger and seal their revenge, for husband and wife had been alike crippled by the heavy hand of justice, which in the last resort met on neither side their indignant claim to get, as they called it, everything. If each was only to get half this seemed to concede that neither was so base as the other pretended, or, to put it differently, offered them both as bad indeed, since they were only as good as each other.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">It was obvious to anyone watching that the only connection she had to either parent was this: she was a convenient receptacle for their bitterness.

They didn't want her for any benefit they could give her, but for the damage they could inflict on each other, with her unwitting help. She was meant to channel their anger and be the instrument of their revenge. Both husband and wife were equally wounded by the harsh verdict of the law, which ultimately didn't side with either of their outraged demands to, as they put it, get everything. If each was only to get half, it was as if they both admitted that neither was as terrible as the other claimed. Or, to put it another way, it made them both appear equally bad, since they were only as good as one another.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">The mother had wished to prevent the father from, as she said, "so much as looking" at the child; the father's plea was that the mother's lightest touch was "simply contamination." These were the opposed principles in which Maisie was to be educated&mdash;she was to fit them together as she might. Nothing could have been more touching at first than her failure to suspect the ordeal that awaited her little unspotted soul. There were persons horrified to think what those in charge of it would combine to try to make of it: no one could conceive in advance that they would be able to make nothing ill.

Some people were horrified by what her guardians would conspire to do to her; no one could have predicted they would end up accomplishing nothing truly harmful.

The pair appeared to have a social attraction which failed merely as regards each other: it was indeed a great deal to be able to say for Ida that no one but Beale desired her blood, and for Beale that if he should ever have his eyes scratched out it would be only by his wife. It was generally felt, to begin with, that they were awfully good-looking&mdash;they had really not been analysed to a deeper residuum.

Notwithstanding some very long lines everything about her that might have been large and that in many women profited by the licence was, with a single exception, admired and cited for its smallness.

The parents come to believe she is stupid. The girl realizes her role as a messenger and decides to stop repeating what she is told. As a result, she is called an idiot and dull by her parents. The girl, Maisie, gets a new governess, Miss Overmore, who replaces a former nurse named Moddle. Maisie's mother hires Miss Overmore. One day, Maisie asks Miss Overmore if she should tell her father a message from her mother: "that he lies and he knows he lies." Miss Overmore turns red, laughs, and pricks her hand with a needle. With her eyes, she communicates that she is afraid of Maisie's mother but also feels loyalty to Maisie's father. This reminds Maisie of a time when she and Miss Overmore met her father in a park. He spoke to Miss Overmore and asked for her help to save his daughter. Afterward, Miss Overmore asked Maisie not to mention the meeting to her mother, and Maisie agreed.</div>

Mrs. Farange then scolds Maisie for expressing her thoughts. The governess, Miss Overmore, explains to Maisie that Mrs. Farange has forbidden her from going and that she has promised not to. Maisie goes to her father's house, where a temporary governess is hired. Within a week, Miss Overmore arrives. She tells Maisie that she broke her promise to Mrs. Farange, went to Maisie's father, and said she couldn't give Maisie up. An arrangement was then made for her to stay.

                <div class="calibre7">A child, Maisie, parts from Mrs. Wix with a silent, intense hug. Maisie's father stands over them, holding an open watch and grinning, while Miss Overmore waits in a brougham outside. Maisie leaves Mrs. Wix and gets into the brougham with her father and Miss Overmore. The carriage drives away. Inside, Miss Overmore hugs Maisie. Maisie, sitting on her father’s knee, asks if he liked Miss Overmore while she was away. Her father laughs and says that when she is gone, all he has left to do is love Miss Overmore. Miss Overmore takes Maisie from him, and they have a playful scuffle over the child. She tells Maisie that if her father says something so "horrid" again, she will take Maisie away so they can live together. Maisie asks her father if Miss Overmore was with him the entire time she was gone. He says she was, which prompts Miss Overmore to protest and demand he "take back" his "fib," but he does not. Miss Overmore tells Maisie a lady needs a "proper reason" to stay with a gentleman. When Maisie asks what a proper reason is, her father makes a joke and tries to take her again, leading to another scuffle. Miss Overmore states that she was with "good friends," and the father adds they were his friends. Later, Maisie plays with her doll, Lisette. In response to one of the doll's indiscreet "questions," Maisie mimics her mother and says, "Find out for yourself!"</div>

"Did papa like you just the same while I was gone?" she enquired&mdash;full of the sense of how markedly his favour had been established in her presence. She had bethought herself that this favour might, like her presence and as if depending on it, be only intermittent and for the season.

Her father enjoyed both her drollery and his own and tried again to get possession of her&mdash;an effort deprecated by their comrade and leading again to something of a public scuffle.

Her embarrassment, of a precocious instinctive order, attached itself to the idea that this was another of the matters it was not for her, as her mother used to say, to go into. Therefore, under her father's roof during the time that followed, she made no attempt to clear up her ambiguity by an ingratiating way with housemaids; and it was an odd truth that the ambiguity itself took nothing from the fresh pleasure promised her by renewed contact with Miss Overmore.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">"She's been surrounded by them constantly&mdash;I'll give her that!"</i></p><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">Maisie was confused and for a while afterward remained uncertain, and slightly embarrassed, about what they were all joking about and where her governess had really been.

                <div class="calibre7">A child, Maisie, lives with her father and her governess, Miss Overmore. Maisie overhears disagreements between her father and Miss Overmore. The father repeatedly suggests sending Maisie to school, but also states that this would cause her mother to intervene. Miss Overmore argues against sending Maisie to school and also rejects hiring a second governess. Miss Overmore tells Maisie that she has other responsibilities to Mr. Farange and the house which interfere with Maisie's education. The house is often full of male visitors who tease Maisie. One visitor jokes that Miss Overmore will not allow another woman near the father. Miss Overmore tells Maisie that her mother, Ida, has gone abroad with a gentleman. Maisie had previously received a letter from her mother announcing her departure. Maisie asks Miss Overmore if the gentleman with her mother could be her tutor. Miss Overmore rejects the idea, calls the man "bad," and embraces Maisie. Previously, Maisie corresponded with a former governess, Mrs. Wix. Miss Overmore reads the letters, calls Mrs. Wix unsuitable, and forbids further communication. She then writes a letter to Mrs. Wix, after which Mrs. Wix stops writing to Maisie.</div>

It was gathered by the child on these occasions that there was something in the situation for which her mother might "come down" on them all, though indeed the remark, always dropped by her father, was greeted on his companion's part with direct contradiction. Such scenes were usually brought to a climax by Miss Overmore's demanding, with more asperity than she applied to any other subject, in what position under the sun such a person as Mrs. Farange would find herself for coming down.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">Eventually, she realized this period wouldn't be marked by formal instruction.

During these encounters, the child understood that her mother could potentially "intervene" in their affairs.

Miss Overmore and Mrs. Wix argue. Mrs. Wix announces she has a message from Maisie’s mother, who is engaged to be married to a man named Sir Claude. Mrs. Wix shows Maisie a photograph of him. Maisie admires the picture and asks to keep it. Mrs. Wix agrees and gives it to her. Maisie hugs Mrs. Wix. While they embrace, Miss Overmore takes the photograph.

After looking at it, she calls the man "horrid" but then hands the picture to Maisie and tells her to place it on the schoolroom mantelpiece. Sometime later, Miss Overmore has married Maisie's father and is now called Mrs. Beale. The photograph of Sir Claude is placed on the mantelpiece. Maisie's education is neglected, and she spends her time with an under-housemaid named Susan Ash. Returning from a walk one day, Maisie is called to the drawing-room where she meets Sir Claude, the man from the photograph. He rises, takes hold of her, and kisses her. Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale have been arranging for Maisie to leave with him to go live with her mother. Sir Claude confirms to Maisie that he has been married to her mother for three months. During a long conversation, Mrs. Beale and Sir Claude discuss the parents and the new arrangement. Mrs. Beale embraces Maisie. Sir Claude then asks Maisie to leave with him immediately. Mrs. Beale agrees and says she will send Maisie's things the next day. After they say their goodbyes, Maisie leaves the house with Sir Claude.</div>

                <div class="calibre7">Mrs. Wix arrives at the home of Maisie's mother. For the first three days, Maisie's mother refuses to see her. During this time, Sir Claude visits Maisie in the schoolroom, explaining that her mother is angry because he arranged for Maisie to come to her house without her knowledge, using it as a way to meet Mrs. Beale. He asks Maisie not to tell her mother what Mrs. Beale said to him. He teases Mrs. Wix and reminds Maisie to remain silent. Mrs. Wix tells Maisie that her mother is passionately in love. Maisie is then summoned to see her mother, Ida, who now has coppery red hair. Ida questions Maisie about what happened between Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale. Maisie pretends to be stupid to avoid answering, and her mother calls her not amusing. After the meeting, Maisie tells Mrs. Wix that her mother said her duty would be done. In the following weeks, Maisie's mother often does not see her for days. Maisie spends her time with Mrs. Wix and Sir Claude. Sir Claude gives gifts to Mrs. Wix (a five-pound note, a book, an umbrella) and to Maisie (chocolates, books, a coat, games, a frame). He takes them to the pantomime and walks with them publicly. Maisie and Mrs. Wix spend their evenings talking about him, unable to understand the rules for the games he bought. Maisie asks Mrs. Wix if she is in love with Sir Claude, and Mrs. Wix says she is. A few days later, Mrs. Wix asks Maisie the same question, and Maisie says she is too. Later, for long periods, Sir Claude and Ida are away from the house, sometimes together and sometimes apart, leaving Maisie and Mrs. Wix alone to forage for food. During one of these times, Mrs. Wix tells Maisie that Mrs. Beale has been trying to see her, that her mother resents it, and that Sir Claude has supported Mrs. Beale in the matter. The text flashes back to an earlier conversation where Maisie, alone with Sir Claude, asked him if he was still in communication with Mrs. Beale.</div>

He then questions Maisie about Mrs. Beale, asking if she truly cares for the child and how her affection compares to that of Mrs. Wix. Maisie says Mrs. Beale loves her and will never give her up. She explains that Mrs. Beale does not write because of "mamma" and that Mrs. Wix dislikes Mrs. Beale but remains silent about it for Maisie's sake. Sir Claude tells Maisie he has not seen Mrs. Beale and cannot visit her because his wife (Maisie's mother) forbids it. He explains Mrs. Beale cannot visit them for the same reason. He tells Maisie he will support her. Maisie reminds him that Mrs. Beale believed Maisie had brought them together. Sir Claude laughs and agrees. Maisie asks if she is going back to Mrs. Beale, and Sir Claude says she will someday. Maisie points out she has also brought him and Mrs. Wix together, which he confirms. He jokingly suggests she bring him and her mother together but then says it is impossible. He reassures her that their own relationship is fine. When Maisie asks how she could ever leave him, Sir Claude suggests her mother might eventually leave him with Maisie. He adds this would be Mrs. Beale's chance to have Maisie back. Maisie asks if he will visit her at Mrs. Beale's, and he says he can. As Maisie presses him for a promise to visit often, Mrs. Wix enters the room. Later, Sir Claude resumes the conversation. He tells Maisie he can secretly visit her when she is with Mrs. Beale, but Mrs. Beale cannot visit their current home because Mrs. Wix would inform Maisie's mother. He clarifies that he and Mrs. Wix are allies on all matters except Mrs. Beale. Finally, he admits he is afraid of Maisie's mother.</div>

                <div class="calibre7">A lady makes visits during which she surveys the room, sometimes sitting and other times pacing. Her behavior toward her child, Maisie, alternates between ignoring her and hugging her. Sometimes she is accompanied by Sir Claude, and during these times she laughs freely. Later, the mother tells Maisie that she has handed over responsibility for her to Sir Claude. She says Sir Claude is not serious. Maisie cries to her governess, Mrs. Wix, about this. Maisie then talks with Sir Claude about her mother. One day, the mother, Sir Claude, Mrs. Wix, and Maisie are in a room together. The mother grabs Maisie, sobs, and accuses Sir Claude of turning the child against her. She then pushes Maisie across the room into Mrs. Wix's arms. Maisie sees Mrs. Wix and Sir Claude exchange a look. When Maisie later asks Mrs. Wix about the incident, Mrs. Wix calls it "her ladyship's game." In response, Sir Claude leaves for Paris alone. While he is away, the mother brings a man named Mr. Perriam to the schoolroom to meet Maisie and Mrs. Wix. After he leaves, Mrs. Wix tells Maisie that Mr. Perriam is very wealthy and that Sir Claude will not like his visits. Sir Claude returns from Paris, bringing a watercolor set for Maisie and a second umbrella for Mrs. Wix. He begins spending more time in the schoolroom with Maisie and Mrs. Wix. Maisie knows that he and Mrs. Wix have late-night talks. Mrs. Wix tells Maisie that they talk about getting Sir Claude into Parliament to save him from "awful misery."</div>

Unaccompanied, in subsequent hours, and with an effect of changing to meet a change, Ida took a tone superficially disconcerting and abrupt&mdash;the tone of having, at an immense cost, made over everything to Sir Claude and wishing others to know that if everything wasn't right it was because Sir Claude was so dreadfully vague.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">Wix said it, completely captivated.

Even a little girl could see that her mother had finally earned the right to such joy&mdash;a little girl whose thoughtfulness was now consumed by happy, selfish thoughts about good omens and future fun. Later, alone, and seeming to shift to accommodate a change, Ida adopted a tone that was superficially unsettling and abrupt&mdash;the tone of someone who, at a tremendous cost, had yielded everything to Sir Claude, and wanted others to know that if everything wasn't perfect, it was because Sir Claude was so impossibly vague.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">"He has made from the first such a row about you," she said on one occasion to Maisie, "that I've told him to do for you himself and try how he likes it&mdash;see?

One of these, visibly, was that the spell rejoiced in by the schoolroom fire was already in danger of breaking; another was that she was finally forced to make no secret of her husband's unfitness for real responsibilities.

Mrs. Wix then reveals that Ida had a terrible argument with her and told her to leave the house immediately. Mrs. Wix says she refuses to leave unless forced by the police and confesses her fears to Maisie. She explains that the tension is greatest between Ida and Sir Claude. After Maisie guesses the wrong man, Mrs. Wix clarifies that Sir Claude is angry with Ida about "someone else." At the mention of another name, Mrs. Wix becomes agitated, and she and Maisie sob in each other's arms. Mrs. Wix then recounts how Ida insulted her, calling her a spy and a hypocrite. The next day, Sir Claude visits for tea. Mrs. Wix proposes that he leave the house and find a lodging to share with her and Maisie. Sir Claude protests, citing his responsibility to his wife, but Mrs. Wix warns him that Ida may leave him first. She describes Ida’s abusive language toward her and says Ida has instructed the servants not to wait on her. Sir Claude worries how it will look if he leaves his wife, but Mrs. Wix insists it will "save" him from another "real bad" woman. Sir Claude takes Maisie into his arms and promises he will never forsake her. Maisie cries silently on his shoulder, and Mrs. Wix sobs aloud. In the following days, Sir Claude intervenes to prevent Ida from forcibly ejecting Mrs. Wix. He sends a large cake for Maisie and Mrs. Wix and begins taking Maisie on frequent outings across London. During these absences, Mrs. Wix endures Ida's insults at home. Sir Claude tells Maisie that Ida despises him for looking after her and accuses him of being afraid of her father. Meanwhile, Ida’s weekly weekend absences from London grow longer.</div>

He calls the religious paintings a "silly superstition," which he clarifies is a comment on the affectation of admiring them. Maisie expresses concern that her governess, Mrs. Wix, will be dismissed. Sir Claude reassures her, explaining that he and her mother have an arrangement to let each other do what they want. On another day in a tea shop, Sir Claude asks Maisie what her father would do if they were to go away together. They discuss being afraid of Maisie's mother. Maisie says she is also afraid of Mrs. Beale. Sir Claude admits he is as well. When Maisie asks if he has seen Mrs. Beale, he says no, but that she has written to him. He then says Maisie has eaten five buns, and she corrects him, saying she had three. Shortly after, Mrs. Wix tells Maisie that Sir Claude has been seeing Mrs. Beale. When Maisie says Sir Claude denied it, Mrs. Wix says she learned it from visiting Mrs. Beale herself. Mrs. Wix cries that they will take Maisie away, and Maisie cries too. They agree not to confront Sir Claude. The next day, Sir Claude takes Maisie in a cab to her father’s new house in Regent’s Park. He says he has brought her to see Mrs. Beale. While still in the cab, he tells Maisie she must decide whether to go in or not. He explains that if she goes in, Mrs. Beale may keep her, and that he cannot leave her mother to form a new family with Maisie and Mrs. Wix. Maisie asks if he will visit her often, and after hesitating, he agrees. Maisie gets out of the cab. Inside the house, waiting for Mrs. Beale, Maisie asks what will happen to Mrs. Wix. Sir Claude replies that she should have thought of that sooner.</div>

The conversation turns to Sir Claude having previously lied to Maisie about visiting Mrs. Beale. Maisie says she knew he had lied because Mrs. Wix told her. Mrs. Beale reveals that Mrs. Wix recently visited her, admitted to seeing Sir Claude, and begged Mrs. Beale to “spare” him. Mrs. Beale kissed Maisie and declared she would not spare him. Maisie asks if Sir Claude will visit often. Mrs. Beale says that she has “squared” Maisie’s father, who is happy that Sir Claude has also quarreled with Maisie’s mother. It is decided that Maisie will stay and live with Mrs. Beale. Sir Claude promises to pack her things and bring them the next day, and he helps her take off her coat. They tell Maisie she will be a "duty" who will "save" them. When Maisie asks about lessons, Mrs. Beale promises she will attend courses and lectures with both her and Sir Claude. Maisie asks what will happen to Mrs. Wix. As he leaves, Sir Claude promises to “square” her. After he departs, Maisie says to Mrs. Beale that everyone will be squared, and Mrs. Beale embraces her.</div>

Five minutes later, they take a hansom to Hyde Park and then walk to Kensington Gardens. In the gardens, Sir Claude points out a man and a woman walking in the distance. Maisie stops and identifies the woman as her mother, Ida. Sir Claude, who believed Ida was in Brussels, looks closer and confirms it is her. The couple in the distance halts, then turns around and starts walking toward them. As they approach, Sir Claude lights a cigarette. Maisie takes Sir Claude's arm, causing them to stop. The other couple also stops. The woman, Ida, walks directly up to them while her male companion takes a wider path. Ida confronts Sir Claude, asking what he is doing with her daughter. Sir Claude asks who the man with her is. Ida glares at Maisie and tells her to go to the gentleman. Sir Claude grabs Maisie's arm and tells Ida that Maisie is his now, stating he has her from her father. Ida argues with him, then opens her arms to Maisie. Sir Claude lets the girl go. Ida embraces Maisie for a moment, then pushes her away and tells her to go to "the Captain." When Maisie questions the name, Sir Claude laughs. Ida calls Sir Claude loathsome and again orders Maisie to be off. As Maisie backs away, Sir Claude yells a curse at Ida. Maisie flees from the argument, running toward the other man.</div>

                <div class="calibre7">A girl, Maisie, meets a Captain and tells him that Sir Claude called her mother a "damned old brute." The Captain first laughs, then repeats her words. Maisie suggests her mother tried to provoke Sir Claude, but the Captain calls her mother an angel. The Captain takes Maisie's hand, and they walk to a pair of chairs. He explains that her mother asked him to look after her while she confronted the "real culprit." He tells Maisie that her mother is the best friend he has ever had. Maisie mentions that she and Sir Claude had mistaken him for other men, Lord Eric and the Count. The Captain corrects her, stating her mother never knew Lord Eric. He tells Maisie never to believe any harm of her mother and praises her character extensively, saying she has suffered and never had justice. Maisie begins to cry and asks the Captain if he loves her mother. He stammers but then says he is tremendously fond of her and calls her an angel again. Maisie sobs. When she implores him to say he loves her mother, he says, "Of course I love her, damn it, you know!" Maisie jumps up and declares that she loves her mother too. The Captain asks Maisie if she will come back to her mother. Maisie says her mother won't have her, especially with Sir Claude. The Captain clarifies it would be in a different place and that her mother will agree if he asks. Maisie asks if he will be there, and he replies, "some day." He then offers to take her with them for an hour and says he will ask her mother immediately. Maisie sees Sir Claude approaching and tells the Captain to leave without meeting him. Before he goes, she asks if he will live with her mother, and he replies, "One of these days." She says Sir Claude won't be the first to leave the marriage. As they say goodbye, Maisie asks him to love her mother "always." She then runs to meet Sir Claude. As she leaves, she hears the Captain say, "Oh I'm in for it!" and sees him and her mother walk off in the same direction. Sir Claude asks Maisie who the man was and what they talked about. Maisie repeatedly claims not to know and says she wasn't paying attention. Sir Claude calls her a dunce and falls silent for the rest of their walk. At the gate, he hails a cab, puts her in it without looking at her, tosses money for the fare onto the seat, tells the driver the destination, and walks away.</div>

The Captain, inclining his military person, sat sideways to be closer and kinder, and as her hand was on the arm of her seat he put his own down on it again to emphasise something he had to say that would be good for her to hear.

The Captain, angling his military frame, sat sideways to be more intimate and accommodating. With her hand resting on the arm of her chair, he placed his own over hers, as if to underscore something important she needed to hear.

                <div class="calibre7">For several days, Sir Claude does not visit. Mrs. Beale's attitude changes. She questions Maisie about an incident with the Captain and demonstrates she already knows what happened between Sir Claude and his wife. Mrs. Beale cries in front of Maisie. Three days after an incident in Kensington Gardens, Sir Claude sends Maisie a message. Mrs. Beale then admits to Maisie that she sees Sir Claude secretly but does not say how or where. She tells Maisie that Sir Claude cannot visit them at Regent's Park. Mrs. Beale begins acting as a messenger, carrying notes between Sir Claude and Maisie almost daily. She tells Maisie that Sir Claude has improved her character. Prompted by Sir Claude, Mrs. Beale organizes a new educational plan for Maisie. Nine books arrive from Sir Claude in one week, and Mrs. Beale begins reading with Maisie. Mrs. Beale stops receiving visitors, telling Maisie it is for her education. Maisie and Mrs. Beale begin attending lectures at an institution; they often rush out of the house to get there on time. Maisie looks for Sir Claude on these outings but never sees him. One day, Mrs. Beale announces they are going to the Exhibition at Earl's Court that night. She confesses that Sir Claude might meet them there, having told her to bring Maisie so he could try to see her. When Maisie asks why he cannot visit them directly, Mrs. Beale explains that Sir Claude has an idea about not getting Maisie "mixed up" in their relationship. Maisie asks Mrs. Beale if she minds. Mrs. Beale says she does not. Maisie then proposes to tell Sir Claude that evening that neither of them minds and to ask him why he does.</div>

Maisie looks for Sir Claude in the gardens but cannot find him. Lacking money for the side-shows, she and Mrs. Beale wait. While standing before a poster, they see a man and a woman come out of a booth. Mrs. Beale recognizes the man as Beale, Maisie’s father, who was believed to be away on a yacht. Beale and the woman turn and walk away. Mrs. Beale calls him a liar and says he never left. Maisie asks who the woman is, and Mrs. Beale says she is a new woman he has been with since Tuesday. The couple then turns and walks back toward them. Mrs. Beale identifies the woman as Mrs. Cuddon. A rapid confrontation follows, during which the woman, Mrs. Cuddon, recognizes them, cries out, and vanishes. Sir Claude is also present but is not seen by Beale. Mrs. Beale says something to Beale about his "new one," he retorts, and she replies loudly. Beale takes Maisie, puts her into a hansom cab, and gets in with her. He gives the driver an address. Inside the cab, he puts his arm around Maisie and trembles. They drive for a long time and arrive at a house. Beale opens the door with a key and takes Maisie upstairs into a decorated drawing-room. They wait together in the room. Maisie asks if the woman is a rich countess. Her father confirms she is an American Countess and says he wants her to see Maisie. He calls Mrs. Beale a fool for misidentifying the woman. He shows Maisie things around the room, gives her chocolates from a box, and sits her on his knee, stroking her hair. He then becomes restless as they continue to wait.</div>

                <div class="calibre7">A man, Beale, lights a cigarette and smokes in his daughter Maisie’s face. He announces he is going to America and asks her to come with him. She eventually agrees to go anywhere with him. He asks about her mother, and Maisie tells him about seeing her in a park with a gentleman. Beale accuses Maisie of having already made a deal to stay with her step-parents, calling them criminals and her a "monster" for siding with them. He warns her they will abandon her and asks if she will risk it. He then confirms that if he goes to America, she will never see him again. In response, Maisie says she cannot give him up. A vehicle arrives, and the Countess enters the room. Beale tells the Countess that Maisie has refused their offer. The Countess invites Maisie to Spa. Maisie asks to be sent home in a cab. Downstairs, Beale gives Maisie a final hug. When Maisie says she has no money for the cab, the Countess gives her a handful of coins. Her father disappears. The Countess puts Maisie in the cab and sends it away. Inside the cab, Maisie looks at the money and sees that it is a handful of gold sovereigns.</div>

What she was able to give him, however, as his blinking eyes seemed to make out through the smoke, would be simply what he should be able to get from her. To give something, to give here on the spot, was all her own desire. Among the old things that came back was her little instinct of keeping the peace; it made her wonder more sharply what particular thing she could do or not do, what particular word she could speak or not speak, what particular line she could take or not take, that might for every one, even for the Countess, give a better turn to the crisis.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">After he lit a cigarette and blew smoke in her face, it was like the match had ignited something strange, a clumsy mix of old professions, old scandals, old duties.

                <div class="calibre7">While Mrs. Beale is out late, the housemaid Susan Ash persuades Maisie to go to bed and to use one of her gold sovereigns to pay for a cab. The next day, Maisie gives the rest of the sovereigns to Mrs. Beale, who calls the money "the wages of sin," puts it in her pocket, and says she will send it back. Mrs. Beale asks Susan for the sovereign she received, but Susan refuses. A few days later, while Mrs. Beale is out, Sir Claude arrives and directs Susan to pack. Sir Claude, Maisie, and Susan travel by cab from London to a hotel in Folkestone. Sir Claude has decided to take Maisie abroad, away from both Mrs. Beale and his wife, Ida. He left a note for Mrs. Beale before departing. While Maisie and Sir Claude are sitting on a bench in the hotel garden, Maisie’s mother, Ida, appears unexpectedly. Ida explains that she went to Mrs. Beale's house and a maid told her where they had gone. Maisie tells her mother they are going to France. Ida says she is ill and also going abroad. She then asks to speak with Maisie alone. Sir Claude is reluctant to leave, but Ida insists. After a brief argument, Sir Claude leaves them. Ida then says to Maisie, "I am good, love."</div>

It was apparently long before Mrs. Beale would arrive, and in the interval Maisie had been induced by the prompt Susan not only to go to bed like a darling dear, but, in still richer expression of that character, to devote to the repayment of obligations general as well as particular one of the sovereigns in the ordered array that, on the dressing-table upstairs, was naturally not less dazzling to a lone orphan of a housemaid than to the subject of the manœuvres of a quartette.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">The money was excessive, even for a fairy tale.

Under the dim light of the lamp, which made the hall a stark contrast to the child's earlier scene of brightness, Susan revealed the half-crown. Even a simple cab driver would know that was the minimum fare. Mrs. Beale wouldn't be back for a while. In the meantime, the decisive Susan had persuaded Maisie to go to bed, like a good little girl. Even better, Maisie, in a particularly generous act, offered to repay both general and specific debts using one of the gold coins from the collection arranged on the dressing table upstairs. The coins were surely as dazzling to the orphaned housemaid as they were to the target of the four people's manipulations.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">This subject went to sleep with her property gathered into a knotted handkerchief, the largest that could be produced and lodged under her pillow; but the explanations that on the morrow were inevitably more complete with Mrs. Beale than they had been with her humble friend found their climax in a surrender also more becomingly free.

Our young lady's consciousness was indeed mainly filled for several days with the apprehension created by the too slow subsidence of her attendant's sense of wrong. These days would become terrific like the Revolutions she had learnt by heart in Histories if an outbreak in the kitchen should crown them; and to promote that prospect she had through Susan's eyes more than one glimpse of the way in which Revolutions are prepared.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">One of the complaints referenced the strange hour&mdash;three in the morning, if the truth be told&mdash;that Mrs. Beale had come back into the house.

A third complaint addressed with some force the question of how much money was owed downstairs in every department for unpaid labor and wasted effort. For several days, our young lady’s awareness was preoccupied by the worry that her attendant’s sense of grievance wouldn't diminish. These days could become terrifying, just like the Revolutions she had memorized from her history books, if a revolt in the kitchen came to a head; to prevent that outcome, she had, through Susan’s observations, received more than one understanding of how Revolutions are brought about.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">To listen to Susan was to gather that the spark applied to the inflammables and already causing them to crackle would prove to have been the circumstance of one's being called a horrid low thief for refusing to part with one's own.

Soon after breakfast, she had been spirited away from London to Folkestone and ensconced in a charming hotel.

Certainly mamma had a charm which, when turned on, became a large explanation; and the only danger now in an impulse to applaud it would be that of appearing to signalise its rarity. Maisie, however, risked the peril in the geniality of an admission that Ida had indeed had a rush; and she invited Sir Claude to expose himself by agreeing with her that the rush had been even worse than theirs.

Certainly, her mother possessed a certain charm which, when activated, provided a comprehensive explanation. The only risk in applauding it now would be to draw attention to how rarely it appeared. Maisie, however, braved this risk with the amiable admission that Ida had indeed been in a rush.

As they sit together, Ida’s hand rests on Maisie's and adjusts her hair and ribbons. Ida tells Maisie she is "criminally good" but has stopped fighting for her. She states that she is very ill, her doctor says she must go away, and she is considering South Africa. She also tells Maisie that her father wishes she were dead. Ida takes a small object out of her purse. Maisie then mentions a Captain who spoke kindly of Ida. Ida becomes angry, calls the Captain a "cad," and insults Maisie for mentioning him. Maisie reveals she had hoped the Captain was the one taking Ida to South Africa. Ida's anger subsides. She puts the object back in her purse, calls Maisie a "dreadful dismal deplorable little thing," turns, and walks away. Maisie sits alone until a gong sounds and Sir Claude appears in a doorway. She goes to him on the lawn. They walk to the house, and Maisie tells him her mother is going to South Africa. He stops walking, laughs, then becomes serious. Maisie also tells him that her mother took money out of her purse and then put it back. After dinner, Maisie and Sir Claude smoke on a terrace and then walk in the garden. He says he is restless and needs to walk alone, telling her to go upstairs to bed. Before she leaves, he says, "I'm free&mdash;I'm free." Maisie repeats his words. He says they will go to France tomorrow, which she also repeats. He again says he is free, and she echoes him. He then draws her close, kisses her goodnight, and sends her upstairs. He turns back to look at the boats as Maisie goes up.</div>

Sir Claude sends Maisie and the housemaid, Susan Ash, out for a walk. Later, Maisie walks with Sir Claude and asks when they will go to Paris. He tells her Paris is too expensive and they are in Boulogne for three or four days to save money. He then says they are waiting for Mrs. Wix, who he reveals has sent him a telegram after seeing Maisie's mother in London. The next day, Maisie and Sir Claude go to the quay in the rain to meet the boat. Sir Claude boards the vessel and returns with Mrs. Wix. At the hotel, Maisie helps Mrs. Wix, who tells her that Sir Claude paid for her new clothes and the trip. Later, the three of them sit in a salon where Sir Claude has a fire lit. After some general conversation, Mrs. Wix announces that Maisie's mother sent her to them.</div>

He sat up, the sheets tangled around his legs, and listened to the sounds of the night. A distant foghorn, the creak of the house settling, the faint whisper of the wind against the windows. He knew he wouldn't be able to sleep again. He rose, pulled on his trousers, and went downstairs.</p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">The next day it seemed to her indeed at the bottom&mdash;down too far, in shuddering plunges, even to leave her a sense, on the Channel boat, of the height at which Sir Claude remained and which had never in every way been so great as when, much in the wet, though in the angle of a screen of canvas, he sociably sat with his stepdaughter's head in his lap and that of Mrs. Beale's housemaid fairly pillowed on his breast. Maisie was surprised to learn as they drew into port that they had had a lovely passage; but this emotion, at Boulogne, was speedily quenched in others, above all in the great ecstasy of a larger impression of life.

His distance had never seemed so vast as it did when he sat companionably, despite the damp, sheltered by a canvas screen, with his stepdaughter’s head in his lap and Mrs. Beale’s housemaid’s head resting comfortably on his chest. Maisie was surprised to discover, as they arrived in port, that they’d had a pleasant crossing. But this feeling in Boulogne was quickly overshadowed by others, especially the sheer joy of a broader experience of life. She was “abroad” and surrendered to it, embracing it in the bright air, in front of the pink houses, among the bare-legged fishwives and the red-legged soldiers, with the immediate certainty of a calling.</i></p></div> </details></p><p class="calibre9"></p><div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre10">[Original]</p><p class="calibre9"></p><p class="calibre11">Her vocation was to see the world and to thrill with enjoyment of the picture; she had grown older in five minutes and had by the time they reached the hotel recognised in the institutions and manners of France a multitude of affinities and messages. Literally in the course of an hour she found her initiation; a consciousness much quickened by the superior part that, as soon as they had gobbled down a French breakfast&mdash;which was indeed a high note in the concert&mdash;she observed herself to play to Susan Ash. Sir Claude, who had already bumped against people he knew and who, as he said, had business and letters, sent them out together for a walk, a walk in which the child was avenged, so far as poetic justice required, not only for the loud giggles that in their London trudges used to break from her attendant, but for all the years of her tendency to produce socially that impression of an excess of the queer something which had seemed to waver so widely between innocence and guilt. On the spot, at Boulogne, though there might have been excess there was at least no wavering; she recognised, she understood, she adored and took possession; feeling herself attuned to everything and laying her hand, right and left, on what had simply been waiting for her.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">Her calling was to observe the world and feel a thrill of pleasure in the spectacle.

She felt a heightened awareness of the superior role she played in relation to Susan Ash as soon as they had devoured a French breakfast, which was, in fact, a highlight of the trip. Sir Claude, who had already run into acquaintances and who, as he explained, had business and correspondence to attend to, sent the two of them out for a walk. During this walk, the child was avenged, as far as poetic justice demanded, not only for the boisterous laughter that used to burst from her companion during their London walks, but also for all the years she had produced a social impression of an excess of a peculiar quality, which had seemed to fluctuate so widely between innocence and guilt. At that moment, in Boulogne, although there might have been excess, there was at least no wavering. She recognized, she understood, she adored, and she claimed it all.

Mrs. Wix tells Maisie that Sir Claude's wife visited her the day before, coming straight from the station. She says his wife helped her, gave her a ten-pound note, and said she wants Mrs. Wix to have Maisie. Upon hearing about the money, Sir Claude laughs loudly. Mrs. Wix rises and stands by the fire. She tells Sir Claude that his wife wants him to get rid of a person from Mrs. Beale's named Susan. Maisie says she doesn't want Susan there. Sir Claude agrees to take Susan back himself. Mrs. Wix objects, suggesting he just pay her fare, but he insists. Sir Claude turns from the window and asks if his wife visited alone. Mrs. Wix says a man was waiting in the cab but did not come up. Sir Claude laughs, walks about the room, and asks who the man was. Mrs. Wix reveals his name is Mr. Tischbein. She then explains that his wife came to her because Maisie needs a "decent person," implying this is to replace Mrs. Beale. Sir Claude defends Mrs. Beale. Sir Claude looks for his hat, and Maisie gets it for him. He says he needs some air. Mrs. Wix accuses him of being afraid of Mrs. Beale. Standing at the door, Sir Claude looks between Mrs. Wix and Maisie, admits, "Yes. I'm simply afraid of her," and leaves the room.</div>

                <div class="calibre7">At an evening meal, a young lady explains the menu to Mrs. Wix. Later, Maisie and Mrs. Wix go to their sitting room while Sir Claude stays downstairs to smoke and talk. Mrs. Wix sits on a sofa, and Maisie attempts to divert her with conversation. Near ten o'clock, Sir Claude enters the room holding up a letter. He approaches Mrs. Wix, takes two papers from the envelope, and gives one to her to read. After reading it, Mrs. Wix stands up, drops the letter, and calls its contents "abominable." Sir Claude explains the letter is from Maisie's father to Mrs. Beale, ending their relationship. Sir Claude offers the letter to Maisie, but Mrs. Wix snatches it, hides it behind her back, and forbids Maisie from seeing it. An argument follows between Sir Claude and Mrs. Wix. He states that he must go to Mrs. Beale. Mrs. Wix warns him that if he sees her again, he is lost. Sir Claude promises to return by Saturday and details the comfortable arrangements he has made for them. Mrs. Wix accuses him of being afraid of Mrs. Beale, then throws herself on the sofa and cries. Sir Claude tells them both to go to bed, announcing that he will leave on an early boat. He opens his arms to Maisie, and she flies into them for a hug. Mrs. Wix jumps to her feet and begs Sir Claude not to go, offering to go in his place to "settle" Mrs. Beale. Sir Claude hesitates, then hugs Maisie again. He tells Maisie to be nice to Mrs. Wix and then leaves the room.</div>

With Mrs. Wix, she uses a carriage and is served food by waiters. They drive on a cliff, walk through a port and streets, and climb to an old rampart. They sit on a bastion, look at the town, and walk through a church, where Mrs. Wix says she should have been a Catholic. They return to the rampart the next morning. An old woman on their bench gets up, says goodbye, and leaves. Maisie and Mrs. Wix bob up in response and sit down again. Maisie asks why the four of them&mdash;herself, Mrs. Wix, Sir Claude, and Mrs. Beale&mdash;cannot be together. Mrs. Wix reacts in shock, calling the idea a "crime." They argue. Maisie suggests Mrs. Wix could remain her companion. Mrs. Wix refuses and questions Maisie's morality. They discuss whether Sir Claude and Mrs. Beale are "free." Maisie reveals that the Countess gave her money, which she then gave to Mrs. Beale, who sent it back. The argument intensifies. Maisie declares her love for Mrs. Beale, and Mrs. Wix says Mrs. Beale is as bad as Maisie's father. Maisie shrieks in denial. Mrs. Wix stands up, and Maisie stands as well. Mrs. Wix walks a few steps away and they stare at each other. Maisie asks if Sir Claude pays Mrs. Wix. Mrs. Wix calls Maisie a "waif" and marches away. Maisie falls back onto the bench and sobs.</div>

Later, in a saloon, they have coffee and liqueurs while waiting for a carriage. Mrs. Wix asks Maisie if she has a "moral sense." They take a carriage ride and then walk on the beach at the coachman's suggestion. They sit on the sand, where Mrs. Wix again asks Maisie about her moral sense. They return to their rooms in the evening, where Mrs. Wix hugs Maisie tightly and speaks about what she has had to learn and say for the child's sake. Maisie stands on a balcony watching a café and listening to musicians. She goes back inside and asks Mrs. Wix if "it" is a crime. Mrs. Wix says it is and that "he" is committing it by being "with her." Maisie tells Mrs. Wix to trust her, and Mrs. Wix puts her to bed. The next morning, no letter arrives from Sir Claude. Maisie and Mrs. Wix walk to a rampart. Mrs. Wix says Sir Claude is afraid of "her" and asks Maisie if she is jealous. Maisie says yes and adds that she would kill "her" if she were unkind to "him." Mrs. Wix cries, and they hold hands. Mrs. Wix says, "I adore him," and Maisie replies, "Oh I know!" A bell summons them to luncheon. They walk back to the hotel and go up to their rooms. Maisie opens the door to their saloon and sees Mrs. Beale standing inside among her bags. Mrs. Beale holds out her arms and says, "I'm free, I'm free!"</div>

                <div class="calibre7">Mrs. Beale arrives, causing Mrs. Wix to sink into a chair. Mrs. Beale embraces Maisie. Maisie sees that Sir Claude's luggage is not with Mrs. Beale and asks if she has come alone. Mrs. Beale confirms she is alone, pats Maisie’s cheek, and announces, "I'm free, I'm free!" Maisie asks where Sir Claude is and if he will come. Mrs. Beale replies that he will, but that they must "make him" and "play our cards." She adds that Sir Claude is as free as she is. Mrs. Beale then tells Mrs. Wix she is counting on her help. She also tells Maisie she has brought her a new hat. A waiter appears and reminds them that lunch is half over. Mrs. Beale tells Mrs. Wix and Maisie to go wash their hands, directs Mrs. Wix to "attend to my daughter," and goes into a neighboring room. Mrs. Wix pulls Maisie into their own room. They discuss whether Mrs. Beale has a moral sense and if she is now Maisie's mother. Mrs. Wix concludes that Mrs. Beale is playing a "game" to win Sir Claude back and that he will eventually come. Mrs. Wix tells Maisie to wash and come down. After washing, they find Mrs. Beale has already gone downstairs. Mrs. Wix stops and asks how Mrs. Beale will pay her bills, stating she has no money. Maisie asks what Mrs. Beale would have lived on if she had stayed in England, and Mrs. Wix replies, "On other men!" before marching downstairs.</div>

                <div class="calibre7">At a meal, Mrs. Beale sits at a table and talks to her neighbor, turning her head and shoulder away from Maisie. For the rest of the day, Mrs. Beale spends time with Maisie and Mrs. Wix, keeping them with her. She takes them walking and driving and proposes they go to a concert, but the plan is cancelled. Throughout the day, Mrs. Beale acts as their guide, talking about her travels and explaining continental life. Before dinner, Mrs. Beale pushes Maisie into a room and helps her get ready. She tells Maisie she is going to divorce Maisie's father to marry Sir Claude. Mrs. Beale explains that Sir Claude paid Maisie's mother to relinquish her parental rights, a deal that will allow him to get a divorce. Maisie says that neither Sir Claude nor Mrs. Beale will get their divorces, admitting she heard this from Mrs. Wix. Mrs. Beale replies that Mrs. Wix is mistaken and that she left Sir Claude because he has not yet gotten his divorce. Mrs. Beale kisses Maisie and asks her to find out if Mrs. Wix likes her. Later, Maisie asks Mrs. Wix if she has been won over and would accept Mrs. Beale as her guardian instead of Sir Claude. Mrs. Wix says that while Mrs. Beale has been polite, she would not like her as a guardian as much as she likes Sir Claude. When Mrs. Wix asks Maisie if she accepts Mrs. Beale, Maisie says no, stating she wants "Him alone or nobody." Mrs. Wix asks, "Not even me?" Maisie begins to undress and tells Mrs. Wix, "Oh you're nobody!"</div>

                <div class="calibre7">A young girl, Maisie, wakes up late to find her governess, Mrs. Wix, already dressed in her room. Mrs. Wix informs her that Sir Claude has arrived. Maisie gets out of bed and begins to get ready. While Mrs. Wix helps her dress, they talk. Mrs. Wix says Sir Claude is with "her" and that "she" will never leave. Mrs. Wix says Sir Claude is weak and that if Maisie and she abandon him, he will be ruined and trapped with the other woman forever. Mrs. Wix brushes Maisie's hair and kisses her cheek during their conversation. After dressing, Maisie decides she must see Sir Claude. Mrs. Wix refuses to go near them and forbids Maisie from entering the salon, saying it is no longer theirs. Mrs. Wix sinks into a chair and covers her face. Maisie grabs her hat and leaves the room alone. Maisie enters the salon, which is empty. Sir Claude steps in from the balcony. He pauses before greeting her, then holds out his hand, meets her, and kisses her. He says he has not seen Mrs. Beale. When Maisie moves toward the door of the room Mrs. Beale had occupied, Sir Claude stops her, saying he only wants to see Maisie. He tells her that he and Mrs. Beale have quarreled. Sir Claude suggests he and Maisie go out for breakfast. As they leave, he stops on the stairs to ask about Mrs. Wix. At the bottom of the stairs, he orders the landlady to send breakfast up to Mrs. Wix's room. The landlady asks about "Madame," and Sir Claude replies, "Nothing yet." He and Maisie then walk toward a café.</div>

To that degree it was successful; there was only an appeal, strange and mute, in the white old face, which produced the effect of a want of decision greater than could by any stretch of optimism have been associated with her attitude toward what had happened.

                <div class="calibre7">Sir Claude and Maisie sit at a table in a café along the quay. A waiter brings them café au lait and buttered rolls. Sir Claude asks if that will be enough food for her until lunch. He then tells her about his trip to London, his journey back, and asks what she and Mrs. Wix did while he was away. Maisie asks if they are going to have lunch with Mrs. Beale. Sir Claude avoids the question and instead asks what Mrs. Wix has said to Maisie about staying with them. Maisie says "Nothing," but then explains that Mrs. Beale has been very kind to Mrs. Wix. The waiter brings their breakfast and pours their coffee. Sir Claude sends the waiter away and continues questioning Maisie about Mrs. Beale's interactions with Mrs. Wix. Maisie says Mrs. Beale talked to Mrs. Wix all day and "made love to her." She asks if Sir Claude hasn't seen Mrs. Beale yet, and he insists he has not, stating he came back only to see Maisie. He confirms that Mrs. Beale will not be leaving, which makes the situation awkward. They order more coffee and rolls. Sir Claude tells Maisie he returned to ask her a question. He takes her hand and asks if Mrs. Wix would now stay with Mrs. Beale even without him, and Maisie says yes. After a long discussion about Mrs. Wix's feelings, Sir Claude asks Maisie if she will choose to let Mrs. Wix go and stay with him and Mrs. Beale. He proposes an arrangement where they would live abroad, with him living nearby but not in the same house. Maisie asks what would happen to Mrs. Wix, and Sir Claude replies that she would go back to London. When Maisie asks who will teach her, he says he will. Sir Claude calls the waiter and pays the bill. He asks Maisie if she would ever stay with Mrs. Wix and Mrs. Beale without him, and she replies, "Never." He asks her again to make her choice. Maisie asks for time to think and says she wants to see Mrs. Wix first. Sir Claude agrees. Maisie reminds him that she brought him and Mrs. Beale together. He laughs, gets up, and says, "Come!"</div>

They had pretty much to themselves the painted spaces and the red plush benches; these were shared by a few scattered gentlemen who picked teeth, with facial contortions, behind little bare tables, and by an old personage in particular, a very old personage with a red ribbon in his buttonhole, whose manner of soaking buttered rolls in coffee and then disposing of them in the little that was left of the interval between his nose and chin might at a less anxious hour have cast upon Maisie an almost envious spell. They too had their café au lait and their buttered rolls, determined by Sir Claude's asking her if she could with that light aid wait till the hour of déjeuner. His allusion to this meal gave her, in the shaded sprinkled coolness, the scene, as she vaguely felt, of a sort of ordered mirrored licence, the haunt of those&mdash;the irregular, like herself&mdash;who went to bed or who rose too late, something to think over while she watched the white-aproned waiter perform as nimbly with plates and saucers as a certain conjurer her friend had in London taken her to a music-hall to see.</p> </div><p class="calibre9"><details><summary>Translation</summary> <div class="calibre8"><p class="calibre11"><i class="calibre12">Once they were seated, things were different.

                <div class="calibre7">A girl, Maisie, and a man, Sir Claude, walk around a town, looking in shop windows and going to the beach and pier. To prolong their walk, Sir Claude suggests they go to the train station to get newspapers. At the station, he buys eleven newspapers and three books. They stand near a train bound for Paris. Maisie asks Sir Claude to take her on the train, and he asks a porter when it departs. The porter says it leaves in two minutes and offers to get their tickets. Maisie tells him to, but Sir Claude hesitates and asks her if she has made a choice. The train departs without them. As they walk from the station, Maisie tells Sir Claude she will leave with him if he agrees to give up Mrs. Beale. They stop at a quay to watch a boat preparing to leave for Folkestone before returning to their inn. In the hotel lobby, they see the luggage of another woman, Mrs. Wix. They go upstairs and sit on the landing. Sir Claude says Mrs. Wix thinks Maisie has abandoned her. Maisie tells him that if he breaks up with Mrs. Beale, she will wait for him until Mrs. Wix has left on the boat. They enter their salon, where Mrs. Beale informs them that she has had an argument with Mrs. Wix, who is now leaving. Mrs. Wix then enters, dressed for travel, and asks Maisie to come with her. A confrontation ensues among the three adults. Mrs. Beale physically restrains Maisie, but Sir Claude makes her let go. Maisie states her condition: she will stay with Sir Claude only if he gives up Mrs. Beale. Sir Claude tells Mrs. Beale that he will never give her up. Upon hearing this, Maisie says goodbye to Sir Claude. Mrs. Beale also says goodbye and leaves the room. Sir Claude opens the door for Maisie and Mrs. Wix. Maisie and Sir Claude shake hands and say goodbye one last time. Maisie leaves with Mrs. Wix and they board the steamer to Folkestone just as it is departing. On the boat, Maisie tells Mrs. Wix that she looked back for Sir Claude but he was not there. Mrs. Wix states that he went back to Mrs. Beale, and Maisie replies that she knows.</div>
