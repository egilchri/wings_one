<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>After her mother’s death, a young woman went to live with her wealthy aunt, Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud). While living in her aunt’s house, she discovered she enjoyed material comforts. She also discovered that her aunt had long been concerned about her family. The young woman, Kate, spent much of her time alone in her room, feeling pressure from her aunt and postponing a "surrender" to her.</p><p>Kate visited her sister, Marian, a widow with four children. During the visit, which took place in Marian's home after the children’s dinner, Marian told Kate not to "throw herself away." Marian explained that she was afraid Kate would marry Merton Densher, whom she dislikes for having no money. Marian insisted that Kate must marry for money and do what their Aunt Maud wants.</p><p>Kate replied that their father had told her the same thing the previous day. She then revealed that she had visited their father and offered to go live with him. Marian reacted with horror. Kate explained that their father had refused her offer, believing she should stay with Aunt Maud and threatening to curse her if she left.</p><p>As Kate was leaving, she asked whom Marian meant by "Aunt Maud's young man." Marian named Lord Mark. Kate dismissed this as gossip. To end the conversation, they agreed that Marian would stop mentioning Lord Mark as long as Kate assured her she was not involved with anyone else. Kate denied everything and left.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Kate is presented as an intelligent, observant, and deeply conflicted young woman whose situation has shifted dramatically. Forced by her mother's death and financial ruin to live with her wealthy aunt, she is acutely aware of her new dependence. She is introspective, analyzing her own surprising susceptibility to the material comforts her aunt provides, while also feeling trapped and scrutinized. She views herself as a "trembling kid" before the "lioness" Aunt Maud, and feels a burdensome, resentful duty toward her sister. She hides her true thoughts from others, often accepting their interpretations of her actions to maintain peace, a state she sees as a "hypocrisy of stupidity."
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
Presented entirely through Kate's perception, Aunt Maud is a formidable and powerful figure. She is physically described as "majestic" and "magnificent," but her personality is seen as "sharp," controlling, and possessing a "strong will." Kate views her as a "lioness" and a "besieger," a complex and "unscrupulous" force who is both "passionate" and "practical." In the past, she maintained a calculated distance from Kate's family, offering just enough to create a sense of grievance. Now, having taken Kate in, her influence is an immense, looming pressure that dictates Kate's options.
<li>*Marian Condrip**</li></ul>
Kate’s elder sister, Marian, is presented as a woman diminished by circumstance. A "demoralised, querulous" widow with children, she has lost her youthful charm and become, in Kate’s eyes, selfish and manipulative. Her situation is one of financial desperation, and she relentlessly pressures Kate to secure their aunt’s fortune for the family’s benefit. She is fixated on Kate making a strategic marriage and is openly hostile to any prospect, like Merton Densher, who lacks money. Her perspective is portrayed as vulgar and "abject," shaped by her unhappy marriage and the influence of her late husband's family.

<p>
She had gone to Mrs. Lowder on her mother's
death—gone with an effort the strain and pain of
which made her at present, as she recalled them,
reflect on the long way she had travelled since then.
There had been nothing else to do—not a penny
in the other house, nothing but unpaid bills that had
gathered thick while its mistress lay mortally ill,
and the admonition that there was nothing she must
attempt to raise money on, since everything belonged
to the "estate." How the estate would turn
out at best presented itself as a mystery altogether
gruesome; it had proved, in fact, since then a residuum
a trifle less scant than, with Marian, she had for
some weeks feared; but the girl had had at the beginning
rather a wounded sense of its being watched
on behalf of Marian and her children. What on
earth was it supposed that <i>she</i> wanted to do to it?
She wanted in truth only to give up—to abandon her
own interest, which she, no doubt, would already
have done had not the point been subject to Aunt
Maud's sharp intervention. Aunt Maud's intervention
was all sharp now, and the other point, the
great one, was that it was to be, in this light, either
all put up with or all declined. Yet at the winter's
end, nevertheless, she could scarce have said what
stand she conceived she had taken. It wouldn't be
the first time she had seen herself obliged to accept
with smothered irony other people's interpretation
of her conduct. She often ended by giving up to
them—it seemed really the way to live—the version
that met their convenience.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>After her mother died, she went to Mrs. Lowder. Remembering the effort and pain that took, she realized how much she'd changed since then. She had no other options—no money in her childhood home, just unpaid bills that piled up while her mother was dying. And she was told not to try to borrow money, because everything was tied up in the "estate." How that estate would work out was a scary mystery. In the end, it turned out to be a little more than she had feared, but at first she felt like someone was watching her, possibly to protect Marian and her children. What did they think she was going to do with it? Really, she just wanted to give up—to forget about her own interests. She probably would have, too, if Aunt Maud hadn't interfered so sharply. Aunt Maud’s intervention was always harsh. The main issue was that she had to either accept everything, or reject it all. Still, by the end of winter, she wasn't sure what her actual position was. It wouldn't be the first time she’d been forced to accept other people's views of her actions, doing it with a hidden smile. She often gave in to them – it felt like the only way to get by – and went along with the version that suited them best.</i></p></div>

<p>
The tall, rich, heavy house at Lancaster Gate, on
the other side of the Park and the long South Kensington
stretches, had figured to her, through childhood,
through girlhood, as the remotest limit of her
vague young world. It was further off and more
occasional than anything else in the comparatively
compact circle in which she revolved, and seemed,
by a rigour early marked, to be reached through
long, straight, discouraging vistas, which kept
lengthening and straightening, whereas almost
everything else in life was either, at the worst, round
about Cromwell Road, or, at the furthest, in the
nearer parts of Kensington Gardens. Mrs. Lowder
was her only "real" aunt, not the wife of an uncle,
and had been thereby, both in ancient days and when
the greater trouble came, the person, of all persons,
properly to make some sign; in accord with which
our young woman's feeling was founded on the impression,
quite cherished for years, that the signs
made across the interval just mentioned had never
been really in the note of the situation. The main
office of this relative, for the young Croys—apart
from giving them their fixed measure of social greatness—had
struck them as being to form them to a
conception of what they were not to expect. When
Kate came to think matters over with the aid of
knowledge, she failed quite to see how Aunt Maud
could have been different—she had rather perceived
by this time how many other things might have
been; yet she also made out that if they had all consciously
lived under a liability to the chill breath of
<i>ultima Thule</i> they couldn't, either, on the facts, very
well have done less. What in the event appeared
established was that if Mrs. Lowder had disliked
them she had yet not disliked them so much as they
supposed. It had at any rate been for the purpose
of showing how she struggled with her aversion
that she sometimes came to see them, that she at
regular periods invited them to her house, and in
short, as it now looked, kept them along on the
terms that would best give her sister the perennial
luxury of a grievance. This sister, poor Mrs. Croy,
the girl knew, had always judged her resentfully,
and had brought them up, Marian, the boys and
herself, to the idea of a particular attitude, for signs
of the practice of which they watched each other
with awe. The attitude was to make plain to Aunt
Maud, with the same regularity as her invitations,
that they sufficed—thanks awfully—to themselves.
But the ground of it, Kate lived to discern, was that
this was only because <i>she</i> didn't suffice to them. The
little she offered was to be accepted under protest,
yet not, really, because it was excessive. It wounded
them—there was the rub!—because it fell short.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>As a child and young woman, the imposing, wealthy home on Lancaster Gate, across the park and the long South Kensington area, seemed to Kate to be the furthest point in her limited world. It was more distant and less frequently visited than anything else in the relatively small world she moved in. Reaching it seemed to involve long, straight, and discouraging paths that always seemed to stretch further, while everything else in her life was either close to Cromwell Road or, at most, in the nearby Kensington Gardens. Mrs. Lowder, her only "real" aunt (not just an aunt by marriage), should have been the one to offer help, both in the past and when serious difficulties arose. Kate had long believed that the gestures Mrs. Lowder made across that distance never truly addressed the situation. Aside from giving the young Croys a sense of their social standing, Mrs. Lowder's main role, as they saw it, was to shape their expectations by showing them what they shouldn't hope for. When Kate later reflected on the situation with more understanding, she couldn't see how Aunt Maud could have acted differently – instead, she realized how many other things could have happened. However, she also understood that if they had all lived under the threat of utter rejection, they couldn't have realistically expected less. The established truth was that even if Mrs. Lowder disliked them, she hadn't disliked them as much as they'd thought. In fact, her visits and regular invitations, and everything she did, seemed designed to show her struggle with her aversion. She kept them around on terms that allowed her sister, Mrs. Croy, to perpetually feel aggrieved. Kate knew that her mother had always judged her resentfully and had raised them to adopt a specific attitude, and they all nervously watched each other to see if they were fulfilling the role. That attitude was designed to show Aunt Maud, as consistently as her invitations, that they were perfectly fine on their own, thank you very much. But Kate later realized the real reason for this was that they *weren't* fine on their own. They were supposed to accept what little she offered with reluctance, not because it was too much, but because it wasn't enough. That's what hurt them.</i></p></div>

<p>
The number of new things our young lady looked
out on from the high south window that hung over
the Park—this number was so great (though some
of the things were only old ones altered and, as
the phrase was of other matters, done up), that life
at present turned to her view from week to week
more and more the face of a striking and distinguished
stranger. She had reached a great age—for
it quite seemed to her that at twenty-five it was
late to reconsider; and her most general sense was
a shade of regret that she had not known earlier.
The world was different—whether for worse or for
better—from her rudimentary readings, and it gave
her the feeling of a wasted past. If she had only
known sooner she might have arranged herself more
to meet it. She made, at all events, discoveries
every day, some of which were about herself and
others about other persons. Two of these—one
under each head—more particularly engaged, in
alternation, her anxiety. She saw as she had never
seen before how material things spoke to her. She
saw, and she blushed to see, that if, in contrast with
some of its old aspects, life now affected her as a
dress successfully "done up," this was exactly by
reason of the trimmings and lace, was a matter of
ribbons and silk and velvet. She had a dire accessibility
to pleasure from such sources. She liked
the charming quarters her aunt had assigned her—liked
them literally more than she had in all her
other days liked anything; and nothing could have
been more uneasy than her suspicion of her relative's
view of this truth. Her relative was prodigious—she
had never done her relative justice. These
larger conditions all tasted of her, from morning
till night; but she was a person in respect to whom
the growth of acquaintance could only—strange as
it might seem—keep your heart in your mouth.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>From the tall window overlooking the park, our young woman observed so many new things (though some were just old things that had been changed or "dressed up"), that her life seemed more and more like an impressive and unfamiliar person. She felt old, considering she was already twenty-five, and she regretted not understanding these things sooner. The world was different than she had previously understood, and she felt like she’d wasted her past. If she'd known earlier, she might have better prepared herself. She discovered something new every day, some about herself and some about others. Two of these discoveries, one about herself and one about someone else, occupied her thoughts. She realized how much material things appealed to her. She blushed to admit that if life now felt appealing, like a well-dressed gown, it was because of the pretty decorations. She was terribly susceptible to pleasure from those kinds of things. She loved the lovely rooms her aunt had given her, literally more than she'd ever liked anything else; and she felt uneasy suspecting her aunt knew this. Her aunt was amazing—she had never fully appreciated her. Her aunt's influence touched everything in her life. But when it came to her aunt, the more she knew, the more apprehensive she became.</i></p></div>

The girl's second great discovery was that, so
far from having been for Mrs. Lowder a subject of
superficial consideration, the blighted home in Lexham
Gardens had haunted her nights and her days.
Kate had spent, all winter, hours of observation that
were not less pointed for being spent alone; recent
events, which her mourning explained, assured her
a measure of isolation, and it was in the isolation
above all that her neighbour's influence worked.
Sitting far downstairs Aunt Maud was yet a presence
from which a sensitive niece could feel herself
extremely under pressure. She knew herself now,
the sensitive niece, as having been marked from far
back. She knew more than she could have told you,
by the upstairs fire, in a whole dark December afternoon.
She knew so much that her knowledge was
what fairly kept her there, making her at times
more endlessly between the small silk-covered sofa
that stood for her in the firelight and the great grey
map of Middlesex spread beneath her lookout. To
go down, to forsake her refuge, was to meet some
of her discoveries half-way, to have to face them
or fly before them; whereas they were at such a
height only like the rumble of a far-off siege heard
in the provisioned citadel. She had almost liked,
in these weeks, what had created her suspense and
her stress: the loss of her mother, the submersion
of her father, the discomfort of her sister, the confirmation
of their shrunken prospects, the certainty,
in especial, of her having to recognise that, should
she behave, as she called it, decently—that is still
do something for others—she would be herself
wholly without supplies. She held that she had a
right to sadness and stillness; she nursed them for
their postponing power. What they mainly postponed
was the question of a surrender—though she
could not yet have said exactly of what: a general
surrender of everything—that was at moments the
way it presented itself—to Aunt Maud's looming
"personality." It was by her personality that Aunt
Maud was prodigious, and the great mass of it
loomed because, in the thick, the foglike air of her
arranged existence, there were parts doubtless magnified
and parts certainly vague. They represented
at all events alike, the dim and the distinct, a strong
will and a high hand. It was perfectly present to
Kate that she might be devoured, and she likened
herself to a trembling kid, kept apart a day or two
till her turn should come, but sure sooner or later to
be introduced into the cage of the lioness.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The girl's second major realization was that Mrs. Lowder hadn't just given a passing thought to the situation; the troubled household in Lexham Gardens had become an obsession for her. Kate had spent the entire winter alone, carefully observing, and her isolation, explained by her mourning, only intensified the impact of her neighbor.</i></p><p><i>Even sitting downstairs, Aunt Maud’s presence weighed heavily on her sensitive niece. Kate now understood that she had been under scrutiny for a long time. She knew more than she could ever have expressed, even sitting by the fire upstairs on a long, dark December afternoon.

She believed she had a right to sadness and stillness; she clung to them because they delayed things. What they mainly postponed was the question of surrender – though she couldn't yet say exactly what she would be surrendering: everything, perhaps. That was how it felt at times, a surrender to Aunt Maud's overwhelming "personality." It was her personality that made Aunt Maud so formidable, and it loomed large because, in the dense, foggy atmosphere of her carefully constructed life, some aspects were exaggerated and others uncertain. Both the vague and the clear aspects of her personality represented a strong will and an iron hand.</i></p><p><i>Kate was fully aware that she might be consumed, and she compared herself to a trembling young goat, kept separate for a short time until her turn came, but inevitably doomed to be brought into the lioness’s cage.</i></p></div>

<div class="original-text">
<p>
The cage was Aunt Maud's own room, her office,
her counting-house, her battlefield, her especial
scene, in fine, of action, situated on the ground-floor,
opening from the main hall and figuring rather to
our young woman on exit and entrance as a guard
house or a toll-gate. The lioness waited—the kid
had at least that consciousness; was aware of the
neighbourhood of a morsel she had reason to suppose
tender. She would have been meanwhile a
wonderful lioness for a show, an extraordinary figure
in a cage or anywhere; majestic, magnificent,
high-coloured, all brilliant gloss, perpetual satin,
twinkling bugles and flashing gems, with a lustre
of agate eyes, a sheen of raven hair, a polish of
complexion that was like that of well-kept china
and that—as if the skin were too tight—told especially
at curves and corners. Her niece had a quiet
name for her—she kept it quiet; thinking of her,
with a free fancy, as somehow typically insular, she
talked to herself of Britannia of the Market Place—Britannia
unmistakable, but with a pen in her
ear, and felt she should not be happy till she might
on some occasion add to the rest of the panoply
a helmet, a shield, a trident and a ledger. It was
not in truth, however, that the forces with which,
as Kate felt, she would have to deal were those
most suggested by an image simple and broad; she
was learning, after all, each day, to know her companion,
and what she had already most perceived
was the mistake of trusting to easy analogies.
There was a whole side of Britannia, the side of
her florid philistinism, her plumes and her train,
her fantastic furniture and heaving bosom, the false
gods of her taste and false notes of her talk, the
sole contemplation of which would be dangerously
misleading. She was a complex and subtle Britannia,
as passionate as she was practical, with a reticule
for her prejudices as deep as that other pocket,
the pocket full of coins stamped in her image, that
the world best knew her by. She carried on, in
short, behind her aggressive and defensive front,
operations determined by her wisdom. It was in
fact, we have hinted, as a besieger that our young
lady, in the provisioned citadel, had for the present
most to think of her, and what made her formidable
in this character was that she was unscrupulous and
immoral. So, at all events, in silent sessions and
a youthful off-hand way, Kate conveniently pictured
her: what this sufficiently represented being that
her weight was in the scale of certain dangers—those
dangers that, by our showing, made the
younger woman linger and lurk above, while the
elder, below, both militant and diplomatic, covered
as much of the ground as possible. Yet what were
the dangers, after all, but just the dangers of life
and of London? Mrs. Lowder <i>was</i> London, <i>was</i>
life—the roar of the siege and the thick of the fray.
There were some things, after all, of which Britannia
was afraid; but Aunt Maud was afraid of nothing—not
even, it would appear, of arduous thought.
These impressions, none the less, Kate kept so
much to herself that she scarce shared them with
poor Marian, the ostensible purpose of her frequent
visits to whom yet continued to be to talk
over everything. One of her reasons for holding
off from the last concession to Aunt Maud was that
she might be the more free to commit herself to
this so much nearer and so much less fortunate
relative, with whom Aunt Maud would have, directly,
almost nothing to do. The sharpest pinch
of her state, meanwhile, was exactly that all intercourse
with her sister had the effect of casting
down her courage and tying her hands, adding daily
to her sense of the part, not always either uplifting
or sweetening, that the bond of blood might play
in one's life. She was face to face with it now, with
the bond of blood; the consciousness of it was
what she seemed most clearly to have "come into"
by the death of her mother, much of that consciousness
as her mother had absorbed and carried away.
Her haunting, harrassing father, her menacing, uncompromising
aunt, her portionless little nephews
and nieces, were figures that caused the chord of
natural piety superabundantly to vibrate. Her manner
of putting it to herself—but more especially
in respect to Marian—was that she saw what you
might be brought to by the cultivation of consanguinity.
She had taken, in the old days, as she
supposed, the measure of this liability; those being
the days when, as the second-born, she had thought
no one in the world so pretty as Marian, no one
so charming, so clever, so assured, in advance, of
happiness and success. The view was different
now, but her attitude had been obliged, for many
reasons, to show as the same. The subject of this
estimate was no longer pretty, as the reason for
thinking her clever was no longer plain; yet, bereaved,
disappointed, demoralised, querulous, she
was all the more sharply and insistently Kate's elder
and Kate's own. Kate's most constant feeling
about her was that she would make her, Kate,
do things; and always, in comfortless Chelsea,
at the door of the small house the small rent of
which she couldn't help having on her mind, she
fatalistically asked herself, before going in, which
thing it would probably be this time. She noticed
with profundity that disappointment made people
selfish; she marvelled at the serenity—it was the
poor woman's only one—of what Marian took for
granted: her own state of abasement as the second-born,
her life reduced to mere inexhaustible
sisterhood. She existed, in that view, wholly for
the small house in Chelsea; the moral of which
moreover, of course, was that the more one gave
oneself the less of one was left. There were always
people to snatch at one, and it would never occur
to <i>them</i> that they were eating one up. They did
that without tasting.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Aunt Maud’s room was also her office, her accounting department, her battleground, and the center of her activities. It was located on the ground floor, opening into the main hall, and it seemed to Kate like a guard post or a toll booth as she went in and out. Aunt Maud was like a lioness waiting for her prey—Kate knew this. She understood that she was perceived as vulnerable. Aunt Maud would have been a remarkable lioness in a show, an extraordinary sight in a cage or anywhere else. She was regal, impressive, vibrant, with a constant sheen of expensive fabrics, glittering details, agate-like eyes, raven hair, and a complexion as smooth as fine china. Her skin looked stretched, especially around her curves and angles. Kate had a private nickname for her—she kept it secret. Thinking of Aunt Maud, Kate playfully imagined her as a symbol of Britain, a strong, unyielding woman, but with a pen tucked behind her ear. Kate felt she wouldn't be truly satisfied until she could add to that image a helmet, a shield, a trident, and a ledger.</i></p><p><i>However, Kate realized that the real challenges she faced weren't so simple. She was learning more about Aunt Maud every day, and she'd already realized that relying on easy comparisons was a mistake. There was a whole side of Aunt Maud, a side of showiness and shallow values, of fancy decorations and overblown emotions. She indulged in superficial things, and her conversations were often misleading. Kate understood that she was a complex and shrewd person. Aunt Maud was as passionate as she was practical. She had a deep-seated set of prejudices. She had a carefully guarded pocket of money that the world recognized her by. She operated with strategic purpose, using both aggressive and defensive tactics. Kate felt she was like someone under siege, with Aunt Maud as the formidable enemy. What made her so dangerous was her lack of scruples and morals.</i></p><p><i>Kate pictured her this way in her own mind. Aunt Maud’s influence created a sense of danger for Kate. The younger woman lingered and hesitated, while the older one, both aggressive and cunning, controlled as much territory as possible.</i></p><p><i>But what, after all, were these dangers, if not the everyday struggles and harsh realities of London life? Mrs. Lowder *was* London, she *was* life—the noise of the siege and the intensity of the fight. There were some things that frightened even the image of Britain. Aunt Maud, however, feared nothing, not even challenging intellectual thought.</i></p><p><i>Kate kept these thoughts to herself. She rarely shared them with poor Marian, whose visits were ostensibly to talk things over. One of Kate's reasons for delaying her final agreement with Aunt Maud was to have more freedom to help her less fortunate relative, Marian, who Aunt Maud wanted nothing to do with. The most difficult part of Kate's situation was that every interaction with her sister weakened her resolve and limited her choices. It further emphasized the role, which was not always uplifting or pleasant, that family played in one's life.</i></p><p><i>She was now confronted with this family bond. The awareness of it seemed to be the most significant thing that had come to her with her mother's death. Much of that awareness had been absorbed and taken away with her mother. Her irritating, demanding father, her intimidating aunt, her nephews and nieces, who had nothing, all intensified Kate's sense of duty and compassion. Kate’s thinking, especially about Marian, was that she could see what could happen to you if you focused too much on family ties. She'd once understood the burden this entailed, back in the days when she, as the second-born, had thought no one in the world was as beautiful as Marian, or as charming, clever, and destined for happiness and success. That view had changed now, but she'd had to maintain a façade of familiarity for various reasons. Marian was no longer beautiful, and Kate didn't see her intelligence as obvious anymore. Nevertheless, bereft, disappointed, demoralized, and irritable, Marian was even more emphatically Kate's elder sister and part of her life. Kate’s most consistent feeling about her was that Marian would force her to do things. Always, in uncomfortable Chelsea, at the door of the small house where Marian lived, and whose small rent weighed on Kate’s mind, she fatalistically asked herself before going inside what Marian would demand this time.</i></p><p><i>She noticed with deep understanding that disappointment made people selfish. She was amazed by the serenity—it was Marian's only comfort—of what Marian took for granted: her own position of subservience as the second-born, her life reduced to nothing more than constant support for her sister. Marian existed, in Kate's view, entirely for the small house in Chelsea, with the moral being that the more one gave, the less of oneself remained. There were always people ready to exploit one’s generosity, and it would never occur to them that they were consuming one’s very being. They did so without any thought.</i></p></div>

There was no such misfortune, or at any rate
no such discomfort, she further reasoned, as to be
formed at once for being and for seeing. You
always saw, in this case, something else than what
you were, and you got, in consequence, none of
the peace of your condition. However, as she
never really let Marian see what she was, Marian
might well not have been aware that she herself
saw. Kate was accordingly, to her own vision,
not a hypocrite of virtue, for she gave herself up;
but she was a hypocrite of stupidity, for she kept
to herself everything that was not herself. What
she most kept was the particular sentiment with
which she watched her sister instinctively neglect
nothing that would make for her submission to
their aunt; a state of the spirit that perhaps marked
most sharply how poor you might become when
you minded so much the absence of wealth. It was
through Kate that Aunt Maud should be worked,
and nothing mattered less than what might become
of Kate in the process. Kate was to burn her
ships, in short, so that Marian should profit; and
Marian's desire to profit was quite oblivious of a
dignity that had, after all, its reasons—if it had
only cared for them—for keeping itself a little stiff.
Kate, to be properly stiff for both of them, would
therefore have had to be selfish, have had to prefer
an ideal of behaviour—than which nothing, ever,
was more selfish—to the possibility of stray crumbs
for the four small creatures. The tale of Mrs.
Lowder's disgust at her elder niece's marriage to
Mr. Condrip had lost little of its point; the incredibly
fatuous behaviour of Mr. Condrip, the parson
of a dull suburban parish, with a saintly profile
which was always in evidence, being so distinctly on
record to keep criticism consistent. He had presented
his profile on system, having, goodness
knew, nothing else to present—nothing at all to
full-face the world with, no imagination of the propriety
of living and minding his business. Criticism
had remained on Aunt Maud's part consistent
enough; she was not a person to regard such proceedings
as less of a mistake for having acquired
more of the privilege of pathos. She had not been
forgiving, and the only approach she made to overlooking
them was by overlooking—with the surviving
delinquent—the solid little phalanx that now
represented them. Of the two sinister ceremonies
that she lumped together, the marriage and the interment,
she had been present at the former, just
as she had sent Marian, before it, a liberal cheque;
but this had not been for her more than the shadow
of an admitted link with Mrs. Condrip's course.
She disapproved of clamorous children for whom
there was no prospect; she disapproved of weeping
widows who couldn't make their errors good;
and she had thus put within Marian's reach one of
the few luxuries left when so much else had gone,
an easy pretext for a constant grievance. Kate
Croy remembered well what their mother, in a different
quarter, had made of it; and it was Marian's
marked failure to pluck the fruit of resentment that
committed them, as sisters, to an almost equal fellowship
in abjection. If the theory was that, yes,
alas, one of the pair had ceased to be noticed, but
that the other was noticed enough to make up for
it, who would fail to see that Kate couldn't separate
herself without a cruel pride? That lesson became
sharp for our young lady the day after her interview
with her father.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She thought there wasn't a problem, or at least nothing that was truly unpleasant, about existing and being aware of yourself simultaneously. You always saw yourself as something different from what you truly were, and as a result, you never found peace in your own situation. However, because she never let Marian truly see her, Marian might not have realized that she herself was also seeing things. So, Kate didn't consider herself a hypocrite in terms of virtue, because she gave herself up completely. Instead, she was a hypocrite in terms of being foolish, because she kept to herself anything that wasn't directly related to her. What she guarded most closely was her private feeling as she watched her sister instinctively do everything possible to please their aunt. This attitude perhaps highlighted how poor you could become if you were overly concerned about not having money. Kate was the one who was meant to manipulate Aunt Maud, and what happened to Kate in the process didn't matter. In short, Kate was supposed to sacrifice everything so Marian could benefit. And Marian's desire to benefit didn't consider the dignity that she, if she had only cared, had reason to maintain. To be properly selfless for both of them, Kate would have had to be selfish, preferring an idea of how she should act – which is, ironically, the most selfish thing of all – over the chance of any advantage for the four children. The story of Mrs. Lowder’s disgust at her older niece's marriage to Mr. Condrip hadn't lost its impact. Mr. Condrip, the pastor of a boring suburban parish, was incredibly foolish, and his saintly profile, which he always displayed, was clearly documented to support consistent criticism. He systematically presented his profile because he had nothing else to offer – no way of confronting the world head-on, no understanding of how to live and mind his own business. Aunt Maud's criticism of the situation remained consistent; she was not the type to think such actions were less of a mistake just because they had acquired more tragic circumstances. She hadn't been forgiving, and the only way she seemed to overlook the issue was to ignore—with the surviving offender—the small, united family they now represented. Of the two terrible events she lumped together, the marriage and the burial, she had attended the former, just as she had sent Marian a generous check before it happened. But this was only a slight acknowledgment of her connection to Mrs. Condrip's choices. She disapproved of noisy children with no future, and she disapproved of weeping widows who couldn't fix their mistakes. Therefore, she had put within Marian's reach one of the few remaining luxuries when so much else was gone: an easy reason to constantly complain. Kate Croy remembered very well how their mother had handled a similar situation in a different context, and it was Marian's noticeable failure to embrace resentment that bound them, as sisters, to almost equal humiliation. If the idea was that, yes, unfortunately, one of them was no longer being noticed, but the other was being noticed enough to compensate, who wouldn't see that Kate couldn't distance herself without being cruelly proud? That lesson became clear to our young woman the day after her meeting with her father.</i></p></div>

It was after the children's dinner, which was also
their mother's, but which their aunt mostly contrived
to keep from ever becoming her own
luncheon; and the two young women were still in
the presence of the crumpled table-cloth, the dispersed
pinafores, the scraped dishes, the lingering
odour of boiled food. Kate had asked, with ceremony,
if she might put up a window a little, and
Mrs. Condrip had replied without it that she might
do as she liked. She often received such inquiries
as if they reflected in a manner on the pure essence
of her little ones. The four had retired, with much
movement and noise, under imperfect control of
the small Irish governess whom their aunt had
hunted out for them and whose brooding resolve
not to prolong so uncrowned a martyrdom she
already more than suspected. Their mother had
become for Kate—who took it just for the effect
of being their mother—quite a different thing from
the mild Marian of the past: Mr. Condrip's widow
expansively obscured that image. She was little
more than a ragged relic, a plain, prosaic result of
him, as if she had somehow been pulled through
him as through an obstinate funnel, only to be left
crumpled and useless and with nothing in her but
what he accounted for. She had grown red and
almost fat, which were not happy signs of mourning;
less and less like any Croy, particularly a Croy
in trouble, and sensibly like her husband's two unmarried
sisters, who came to see her, in Kate's
view, much too often and stayed too long, with the
consequence of inroads upon the tea and bread-and-butter—matters
as to which Kate, not unconcerned
with the tradesmen's books, had feelings.
About them, moreover, Marian <i>was</i> touchy, and
her nearer relative, who observed and weighed
things, noted as an oddity that she would have
taken any reflection on them as a reflection on herself.
If that was what marriage necessarily did to
you, Kate Croy would have questioned marriage.
It was a grave example, at any rate, of what a man—and
such a man!—might make of a woman. She
could see how the Condrip pair pressed their
brother's widow on the subject of Aunt Maud—who
wasn't, after all, <i>their</i> aunt; made her, over
their interminable cups, chatter and even swagger
about Lancaster Gate, made her more vulgar than
it had seemed written that any Croy could possibly
become on such a subject. They laid it down, they
rubbed it in, that Lancaster Gate was to be kept
in sight, and that she, Kate, was to keep it; so
that, curiously, or at all events sadly, our young
woman was sure of being, in her own person, more
permitted to them as an object of comment than
they would in turn ever be permitted to herself.
The beauty of which, too, was that Marian didn't
love them. But they were Condrips—they had
grown near the rose; they were almost like Bertie
and Maudie, like Kitty and Guy. They talked of
the dead to her, which Kate never did; it being a
relation in which Kate could but mutely listen. She
couldn't indeed too often say to herself that if that
was what marriage did to you——! It may easily
be guessed, therefore, that the ironic light of such
reserves fell straight across the field of Marian's
warning. "I don't quite see," she answered,
"where, in particular, it strikes you that my danger
lies. I'm not conscious, I assure you, of the least
'disposition' to throw myself anywhere. I feel
as if, for the present, I have been quite sufficiently
thrown."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was after the children and their mother had eaten dinner. Their aunt usually avoided eating the same meal. The two young women were still surrounded by the messy table, the discarded children's aprons, the dirty dishes, and the lingering smell of cooked food. Kate had formally asked if she could open a window a little, and Mrs. Condrip had replied, without much enthusiasm, that she could do as she liked. She often reacted to such questions as if they questioned the purity of her children. The four children had retreated, making a lot of noise, under the not-very-effective supervision of the young Irish governess their aunt had hired. Kate suspected the governess was already planning to quit her miserable job. For Kate, their mother—who she viewed simply as "the mother"—had become very different from the gentle Marian of the past. Mr. Condrip's widow completely overshadowed that image. She was reduced to a tired, unremarkable version of herself, almost as if she’d been forced through a difficult experience and left crumpled and useless, defined only by her husband. She had become red-faced and almost fat, which wasn't a good sign for someone in mourning. She resembled the husband's two unmarried sisters less and less, especially a Croy in trouble, and instead, took on more of their appearance. Those sisters visited her, in Kate's opinion, far too often and stayed too long, which resulted in them eating a lot of tea and bread-and-butter—something Kate, who was familiar with the household accounts, cared about. Moreover, Marian was sensitive about her sisters-in-law, and Kate, who observed and judged things, found it strange that Marian would take any criticism of her sisters-in-law as a criticism of herself. If marriage did that to you, Kate Croy would have thought twice about getting married. It was a clear example of what a man—especially a man like him!—could do to a woman. She could see how the Condrip sisters pressured their brother's widow about Aunt Maud—who wasn't actually their aunt. They made her, over their endless cups of tea, gossip and even boast about Lancaster Gate, making her more vulgar than any Croy should ever become on the subject. They insisted that Lancaster Gate should remain a goal, and that she, Kate, should keep it in mind. Therefore, strangely, or at least sadly, Kate realized that she was more of a subject of gossip for them than they would ever be for her. The ironic part was that Marian didn't even like them. But they were Condrips—they were connected to wealth and privilege; they were almost like Bertie and Maudie, like Kitty and Guy. They talked about the deceased Mr. Condrip to Marian, which Kate never did. She could only listen silently. She couldn't help but think to herself, if that was what marriage did to you…! It is easy to guess, therefore, that Marian’s warning fell on deaf ears. "I don't understand," she replied, "what specific danger you think I'm in. I assure you, I'm not at all inclined to throw myself into anything. I feel like I've already been through quite enough."</i></p></div>

If you went to your father, you wouldn't be able to see me anymore." Marian presented it this way, making it sound like a hardship she hoped her friend would avoid. These were the kinds of threats she was comfortable making, and she considered herself clever for doing so. "But if he refuses you," she continued, "at least it shows he's smart."</i></p></div>

Marian had always her views of sharpness; she
was, as her sister privately commented, great on
it. But Kate had her refuge from irritation. "He
won't take me," she simply repeated. "But he
believes, like you, in Aunt Maud. He threatens
me with his curse if I leave her."

"So you <i>won't?"</i> As the girl at first said nothing
her companion caught at it. "You won't, of
course? I see you won't. But I don't see why,
nevertheless, I shouldn't insist to you once for all
on the plain truth of the whole matter. The truth,

"Oh, I don't pretend to be immense, but I pretend
to know more than you do of life; more even
perhaps than papa." Marian seemed to see that
personage at this moment, nevertheless, in the light
of a kinder irony. "Poor old papa!"

She sighed it with as many condonations as her
sister's ear had more than once caught in her "Dear
old Aunt Maud!" These were things that made
Kate, for the time, turn sharply away, and she gathered
herself now to go. They were the note again
of the abject; it was hard to say which of the persons
in question had most shown how little they
liked her. The younger woman proposed, at any
rate, to let discussion rest, and she believed that,
for herself, she had done so during the ten minutes
that, thanks to her wish not to break off short,
elapsed before she could gracefully withdraw. It
then appeared, however, that Marian had been discussing
still, and there was something that, at the
last, Kate had to take up. "Whom do you mean
by Aunt Maud's young man?"

It was that feeling of being pathetic again; it was hard to say who disliked her more in this situation. The younger woman decided to stop talking, and she thought she had, for the last ten minutes. That's how long it had taken her to politely excuse herself because she didn't want to abruptly end the conversation. But then it turned out Marian was still talking, and Kate had to say something.

She had no sooner spoken than she asked herself
what had become of the grace to which she
had sacrificed. Marian certainly did little to save
it, and nothing indeed was so inconsequent as her
ground of complaint. She desired her to "work"
Lancaster Gate as she believed that scene of abundance
could be worked; but she now didn't see
why advantage should be taken of the bloated connection
to put an affront on her own poor home.
She appeared in fact for the moment to take the
position that Kate kept her in her "hole" and
then heartlessly reflected on her being in it. Yet
she didn't explain how she had picked up the report
on which her sister had challenged her—so
that it was thus left to her sister to see in it, once
more, a sign of the creeping curiosity of the Miss
Condrips. They lived in a deeper hole than Marian,
but they kept their ear to the ground, they
spent their days in prowling, whereas Marian, in
garments and shoes that seemed steadily to grow
looser and larger, never prowled. There were times
when Kate wondered if the Miss Condrips were
offered her by fate as a warning for her own future—to
be taken as showing her what she herself
might become at forty if she let things too recklessly
go. What was expected of her by others—and
by so many of them—could, all the same, on
occasion, present itself as beyond a joke; and this
was just now the aspect it particularly wore. She
was not only to quarrel with Merton Densher to
oblige her five spectators—with the Miss Condrips
there were five; she was to set forth in pursuit of
Lord Mark on some preposterous theory of the
premium attached to success. Mrs. Lowder's hand
had attached it, and it figured at the end of the
course as a bell that would ring, break out into
public clamour, as soon as touched. Kate reflected
sharply enough on the weak points of this fond
fiction, with the result at last of a certain chill for
her sister's confidence; though Mrs. Condrip still
took refuge in the plea—which was after all the
great point—that their aunt would be munificent
when their aunt should be pleased. The exact identity
of her candidate was a detail; what was of the
essence was her conception of the kind of match it
was open to her niece to make with her aid. Marian
always spoke of marriages as "matches," but
that was again a detail. Mrs. Lowder's "aid"
meanwhile awaited them—if not to light the way
to Lord Mark, then to somebody better. Marian
would put up, in fine, with somebody better; she
only wouldn't put up with somebody so much
worse. Kate had, once more, to go through all
this before a graceful issue was reached. It was
reached by her paying with the sacrifice of Mr.
Densher for her reduction of Lord Mark to the
absurd. So they separated softly enough. She was
to be let off hearing about Lord Mark so long as
she made it good that she wasn't underhand about
anybody else. She had denied everything and
every one, she reflected as she went away—and that
was a relief; but it also made rather a clean sweep
of the future. The prospect put on a bareness that
already gave her something in common with the
Miss Condrips.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>No sooner had she spoken than she questioned the sense of the sacrifice she had made. Marian certainly wasn't helping the situation, and her complaints were completely illogical. Marian wanted her to "work" Lancaster Gate, believing that area of wealth could be exploited, but now she didn't see why they should use that wealthy connection to insult her own modest home. In fact, she seemed to momentarily believe that Kate was keeping her down and then callously criticized her for it. Yet, she didn't explain how she'd gotten the information that her sister had confronted her with, so it fell to Kate to see it as another sign of the nosy Miss Condrips' creeping curiosity. They lived in a worse situation than Marian, but they kept their ears open and spent their days spying, while Marian, in clothes and shoes that seemed to get bigger and baggier, never bothered. Sometimes, Kate wondered if the Miss Condrips were a warning from fate about her own future—a picture of what she herself might become at forty if she let things get out of control. What was expected of her by others—and by so many of them—could, at times, become unbearable, and that was exactly how it felt now. Not only was she expected to break up with Merton Densher to please her five onlookers—with the Miss Condrips, there were five; she was also supposed to chase after Lord Mark based on some absurd theory about the advantages of success. Mrs. Lowder had created this idea, and it was now like a bell at the end of the race that would ring and cause a public outcry the moment it was touched. Kate considered the flaws in this ridiculous plan, which ultimately made her lose some faith in her sister's confidence. However, Mrs. Condrip took comfort in the fact that their aunt would be generous when she was pleased, which was the most important point. The exact person she chose didn't matter; the key was her idea of the kind of match her niece could make with her help. Marian always called marriages "matches," but that was just another detail. Mrs. Lowder's "help" was waiting for them—if not to lead them to Lord Mark, then to someone better. Marian would be okay with someone better; she just wouldn't accept someone worse. Kate had to go through all of this again before finding a graceful way out. She found it by sacrificing Mr. Densher to make Lord Mark seem ridiculous. So they parted quietly. She wouldn't have to hear about Lord Mark as long as she was honest about everyone else. She had denied everything and everyone, she reflected as she left—and that was a relief; but it also made the future feel very uncertain. The prospect became so bleak that she already felt like she had something in common with the Miss Condrips.</i></p></div>
