<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Merton Densher, who works nights at a newspaper, often spends time during the day in Kensington Gardens. He walks around without a clear destination, stopping, sitting, and walking again.</p><p>On several of these days, Kate Croy comes out of her aunt's house, crosses the road, and meets him in the Gardens. They then walk together or sit on chairs away from others.</p><p>They first met at a party in a gallery. After being introduced, they talked and looked at each other intently. Six months later, they saw each other on the Underground Railway. They exchanged looks, and Densher stayed on the train past his stop. He moved to sit next to her when a seat became available, and when she got off, he followed her. They walked together.</p><p>After this, Densher asked to visit her, and she agreed. He began visiting her at her aunt's, Mrs. Lowder's, house. Mrs. Lowder invited him to dinner and continued to receive his visits.</p><p>During one of their meetings in the park, Kate tells Densher she is sure her aunt will write to him and that he should be prepared. Densher asks if the aunt thinks he is not good enough for Kate, and Kate clarifies that the aunt thinks he is not good enough for her.</p><p>Kate then tells Densher about her family’s misfortunes, including her father's dishonor, the deaths of her two brothers, and her sister's unhappy marriage. She recounts how she learned of her father's disgrace as a girl without ever knowing the specific details. She tells Densher that she recently offered to go and live with her father to escape her aunt, but he refused her. Both her father and sister insist she must stay with her aunt to be of value to them.</p><p>Densher asks Kate to marry him the next day. She tells him to wait until after he has seen her aunt. He questions her, and she says he is also afraid of her aunt. She states that she will "try for everything" and not sacrifice him. She suggests they should wait and see what they can get from her aunt. Densher asks if his role is to win over the aunt. Kate impatiently tells him to "See her." He asks if he should grovel to her. In response, Kate tells him to do what he likes and walks away.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Merton Densher** is presented as a young journalist whose professional life at night affords him an "appearance of leisure" by day. He is physically described as a "longish, leanish, fairish" Englishman who is difficult to classify by profession or social type; he appears "vague without looking weak—idle without looking empty." He is self-aware of his "strength merely for thought" and his perceived inability to become wealthy. His situation shifts from a routine of aimless-seeming meetings with Kate in Kensington Gardens to an impending confrontation. He is informed by Kate that her aunt will be contacting him, forcing his private relationship into a more formal and challenging context where his "want of means" will be scrutinized.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy** is presented as a sharp, self-aware, and strategic young woman burdened by a disgraced father and a needy family. She is described as "handsome, no doubt, but as hard, and... clever but as cold." She values Densher for his intellect—what she calls "the high, dim things... of the mind"—which her own life has lacked. Her situation is one of calculated risk: she lives under the watch of her powerful aunt while conducting a semi-public romance with Densher. The immediate shift is her decision to precipitate a confrontation between Densher and her aunt, moving their relationship from a private understanding to a direct negotiation with the powerful forces controlling her life.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)** is presented indirectly, through the perceptions of Kate and Densher, as a formidable and wealthy matriarch. She is described as "deep," manipulative, and powerful, a figure who has been "giving them rope." Densher sees her as "magnificently vulgar" and "dangerous," while Kate uses the metaphor of an "eagle with gilded claws." Her situation shifts from that of a passive but knowing observer to an active participant. Her impending decision to formally contact Densher signals the end of her observational period and the beginning of her direct intervention in the couple's affairs.</li></ul>

Merton Densher, who passed the best
hours of each night at the office of his newspaper,
had at times, during the day, to make up for
it, a sense, or at least an appearance, of leisure, in
accordance with which he was not infrequently to
be met, in different parts of the town, at moments
when men of business are hidden from the public
eye. More than once, during the present winter's
end, he had deviated, toward three o'clock, or toward
four, into Kensington Gardens, where he might
for a while, on each occasion, have been observed
to demean himself as a person with nothing to do.
He made his way indeed, for the most part, with
a certain directness, over to the north side; but
once that ground was reached his behaviour was
noticeably wanting in point. He moved seemingly
at random from alley to alley; he stopped for no
reason and remained idly agaze; he sat down in
a chair and then changed to a bench; after which
he walked about again, only again to repeat both
the vagueness and the vivacity. Distinctly, he was
a man either with nothing at all to do or with ever
so much to think about; and it was not to be denied
that the impression he might often thus easily
make had the effect of causing the burden of proof,
in certain directions, to rest on him. It was a little
the fault of his aspect, his personal marks, which
made it almost impossible to name his profession.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Merton Densher, who spent most of his nights working at the newspaper office, sometimes had to compensate during the day. He gave the impression of having free time, and as a result, he was often seen in various parts of the city at times when businessmen were usually out of sight. Several times this winter, around three or four in the afternoon, he had gone to Kensington Gardens, where he could be observed acting like someone with nothing to do. He usually went directly to the north side of the park, but once he got there, his actions became aimless. He wandered from path to path, stopped for no particular reason, and stared blankly. He sat in a chair, then moved to a bench, after which he resumed wandering, repeating the same aimlessness and energy. Clearly, he was either completely idle or deeply lost in thought. There was no denying that the impression he often created this way made people question his purpose. This was partly due to his appearance and his distinctive features, which made it difficult to guess his profession.</i></p></div>

<p>
He was a longish, leanish, fairish young Englishman,
not unamenable, on certain sides, to classification—as
for instance by being a gentleman, by
being rather specifically one of the educated, one
of the generally sound and generally pleasant; yet,
though to that degree neither extraordinary nor
abnormal, he would have failed to play straight into
an observer's hands. He was young for the House
of Commons, he was loose for the army. He was
refined, as might have been said, for the city, and,
quite apart from the cut of his cloth, he was sceptical,
it might have been felt, for the church. On
the other hand he was credulous for diplomacy, or
perhaps even for science, while he was perhaps at
the same time too much in his mere senses for
poetry, and yet too little in them for art. You
would have got fairly near him by making out in
his eyes the potential recognition of ideas; but you
would have quite fallen away again on the question
of the ideas themselves. The difficulty with Densher
was that he looked vague without looking
weak—idle without looking empty. It was the accident,
possibly, of his long legs, which were apt to
stretch themselves; of his straight hair and his well-shaped
head, never, the latter, neatly smooth, and
apt, into the bargain, at the time of quite other
calls upon it, to throw itself suddenly back and,
supported behind by his uplifted arms and interlocked
hands, place him for unconscionable periods
in communion with the ceiling, the tree-tops, the
sky. He was in short visibly absent-minded, irregularly
clever, liable to drop what was near and to
take up what was far; he was more a respecter, in
general, than a follower of custom. He suggested
above all, however, that wondrous state of youth
in which the elements, the metals more or less
precious, are so in fusion and fermentation that
the question of the final stamp, the pressure that
fixes the value, must wait for comparative coolness.
And it was a mark of his interesting mixture that
if he was irritable it was by a law of considerable
subtlety—a law that, in intercourse with him, it
might be of profit, though not easy, to master.
One of the effects of it was that he had for you
surprises of tolerance as well as of temper.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He was a somewhat tall, thin, and rather pale young English man, who was fairly easy to categorize based on certain characteristics. For example, he was a gentleman and clearly educated, with a generally good and agreeable personality. However, despite being relatively ordinary, he wouldn't fit neatly into any preconceived box. He was considered young for a member of Parliament and didn't seem suited for the military. He was too sophisticated, you might say, for a career in finance, and, regardless of his appearance, he was probably too skeptical for the church. Conversely, he seemed trusting enough for a career in diplomacy, or perhaps even in science. He also seemed too focused on physical sensation to appreciate poetry, but not quite focused enough to be truly passionate about art. You could come close to understanding him by noticing in his eyes a potential for understanding ideas, but you would be disappointed by his actual views on those ideas. The problem with Densher was that he appeared to be absent-minded without appearing weak, and lazy without appearing unintelligent. This might have been due to his long legs, which he often stretched out; his straight hair, and his well-shaped head, which never looked perfectly neat. He had a habit of throwing his head back, supported by his raised arms and clasped hands, and gazing at the ceiling, the trees, or the sky for long periods. In short, he was visibly distracted, irregularly intelligent, and tended to forget about what was close at hand while focusing on things that were far away. He generally respected tradition more than he followed it. Above all, he embodied that extraordinary state of youth, where the different aspects of a person, like valuable metals, are in a constant state of flux, and the final shaping, the thing that gives them their true value, has to wait until things settle down. And a sign of his fascinating complexity was that his irritability followed a subtle and complex pattern – a pattern that, in interacting with him, could be rewarding to understand, although not easy to do so. One result of this was that he could surprise you with his tolerance just as easily as he could with his temper.</i></p></div>

He loitered, on the best of the relenting days,
the several occasions we speak of, along the part
of the Gardens nearest to Lancaster Gate, and
when, always, in due time, Kate Croy came out of
her aunt's house, crossed the road and arrived by
the nearest entrance, there was a general publicity
in the proceeding which made it slightly anomalous.
If their meeting was to be bold and free it might
have taken place within doors; if it was to be shy
or secret it might have taken place almost anywhere
better than under Mrs. Lowder's windows.
They failed indeed to remain attached to that spot;
they wandered and strolled, taking in the course
of more than one of these interviews a considerable
walk, or else picked out a couple of chairs under
one of the great trees and sat as much apart—apart
from every one else—as possible. But Kate
had, each time, at first, the air of wishing to expose
herself to pursuit and capture if those things were
in question. She made the point that she was not
underhand, any more than she was vulgar; that the
Gardens were charming in themselves and this use
of them a matter of taste; and that, if her aunt
chose to glare at her from the drawing-room or to
cause her to be tracked and overtaken, she could at
least make it convenient that this should be easily
done. The fact was that the relation between these
young persons abounded in such oddities as were
not inaptly symbolised by assignations that had a
good deal more appearance than motive. Of the
strength of the tie that held them we shall sufficiently
take the measure; but it was meanwhile almost
obvious that if the great possibility had come
up for them it had done so, to an exceptional degree,
under the protection of the famous law of
contraries. Any deep harmony that might eventually
govern them would not be the result of their
having much in common—having anything, in fact,
but their affection; and would really find its explanation
in some sense, on the part of each, of
being poor where the other was rich. It is nothing
new indeed that generous young persons often admire
most what nature hasn't given them—from
which it would appear, after all, that our friends
were both generous.

Merton Densher had repeatedly said to himself—and
from far back—that he should be a fool not
to marry a woman whose value would be in her
differences; and Kate Croy, though without having
quite so philosophised, had quickly recognised
in the young man a precious unlikeness. He represented
what her life had never given her and certainly,
without some such aid as his, never would
give her; all the high, dim things she lumped together
as of the mind. It was on the side of the
mind that Densher was rich for her, and mysterious
and strong; and he had rendered her in especial
the sovereign service of making that element real.
She had had, all her days, to take it terribly on
trust; no creature she had ever encountered having
been able in any degree to testify for it directly.
Vague rumours of its existence had made their
precarious way to her; but nothing had, on the
whole, struck her as more likely than that she should
live and die without the chance to verify them.
The chance had come—it was an extraordinary one—on
the day she first met Densher; and it was to
the girl's lasting honour that she knew on the spot
what she was in the presence of. That occasion
indeed, for everything that straightway flowered in
it, would be worthy of high commemoration;
Densher's perception went out to meet the young
woman's and quite kept pace with her own recognition.
Having so often concluded on the fact of
his weakness, as he called it, for life—his strength
merely for thought—life, he logically opined, was
what he must somehow arrange to annex and possess.
This was so much a necessity that thought
by itself only went on in the void; it was from
the immediate air of life that it must draw its breath.
So the young man, ingenious but large, critical but
ardent too, made out both his case and Kate Croy's.
They had originally met before her mother's death—an
occasion marked for her as the last pleasure
permitted by the approach of that event; after
which the dark months had interposed a screen and,
for all Kate knew, made the end one with the beginning.

Throughout her life, she'd had to accept it entirely on faith; no one she'd ever met had been able to provide any concrete proof of it.

The beginning—to which she often went back—had
been a scene, for our young woman, of supreme
brilliancy; a party given at a "gallery" hired by a
hostess who fished with big nets. A Spanish
dancer, understood to be at that moment the delight
of the town, an American reciter, the joy of
a kindred people, an Hungarian fiddler, the wonder
of the world at large—in the name of these and
other attractions the company in which, by a rare
privilege, Kate found herself had been freely convoked.
She lived under her mother's roof, as she
considered, obscurely, and was acquainted with few
persons who entertained on that scale; but she had
had dealings with two or three connected, as appeared,
with such—two or three through whom
the stream of hospitality, filtered or diffused, could
thus now and then spread to outlying receptacles.
A good-natured lady in fine, a friend of her mother
and a relative of the lady of the gallery, had offered
to take her to the party in question and had there
fortified her, further, with two or three of those
introductions that, at large parties, lead to other
things—that had at any rate, on this occasion, culminated
for her in conversation with a tall, fair,
slightly unbrushed and rather awkward, but on the
whole not dreary, young man. The young man had
affected her as detached, as—it was indeed what
he called himself—awfully at sea, as much more distinct
from what surrounded them than any one
else appeared to be, and even as probably quite disposed
to be making his escape when pulled up to
be placed in relation with her. He gave her his
word for it indeed, that same evening, that only
their meeting had prevented his flight, but that now
he saw how sorry he should have been to miss it.
This point they had reached by midnight, and
though in respect to such remarks everything was
in the tone, the tone was by midnight there too.
She had had originally her full apprehension of his
coerced, certainly of his vague, condition—full apprehensions
often being with her immediate; then
she had had her equal consciousness that, within
five minutes, something between them had—well,
she couldn't call it anything but <i>come.</i> It was nothing,
but it was somehow everything—it was that
something for each of them had happened.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The beginning – which she often revisited in her mind – was a dazzling experience for our young woman. It was a party at a rented art gallery, thrown by a hostess known for her lavish events. There was a Spanish dancer, considered the city’s favorite at the time, an American comedian, a hit with his countrymen, and a Hungarian violinist, who was celebrated worldwide. These, along with other performers, were the main attractions, and the party was easily filled with guests, including Kate, who was fortunate enough to have received an invitation.</i></p><p><i>She lived at home with her mother, feeling rather unnoticed by society. She only knew a few people who were connected with lavish parties like this one, people who helped the hostess spread her invitations to a wider circle. A kind woman, a friend of her mother and related to the gallery hostess, had offered to take Kate to the party.

They had found themselves looking at each other
straight, and for a longer time on end than was
usual even at parties in galleries; but that, after all,
would have been a small affair, if there hadn't been
something else with it. It wasn't, in a word, simply
that their eyes had met; other conscious organs,
faculties, feelers had met as well, and when Kate
afterwards imaged to herself the sharp, deep fact
she saw it, in the oddest way, as a particular performance.
She had observed a ladder against a
garden wall, and had trusted herself so to climb
it as to be able to see over into the probable garden
on the other side. On reaching the top she had
found herself face to face with a gentleman engaged
in a like calculation at the same moment, and the
two inquirers had remained confronted on their
ladders. The great point was that for the rest of
that evening they had been perched—they had not
climbed down; and indeed, during the time that
followed, Kate at least had had the perched feeling—it
was as if she were there aloft without a retreat.
A simpler expression of all this is doubtless but
that they had taken each other in with interest; and
without a happy hazard six months later the incident
would have closed in that account of it. The
accident, meanwhile, had been as natural as anything
in London ever is: Kate had one afternoon
found herself opposite Mr. Densher on the Underground
Railway. She had entered the train at
Sloane Square to go to Queen's Road, and the carriage
in which she had found a place was all but
full. Densher was already in it—on the other
bench and at the furthest angle; she was sure of
him before they had again started. The day and
the hour were darkness, there were six other persons,
and she had been busy placing herself; but
her consciousness had gone to him as straight as
if they had come together in some bright level of
the desert. They had on neither part a second's
hesitation; they looked across the choked compartment
exactly as if she had known he would
be there and he had expected her to come in; so
that, though in the conditions they could only exchange
the greeting of movements, smiles, silence,
it would have been quite in the key of these passages
that they should have alighted for ease at the
very next station. Kate was in fact sure that the
very next station was the young man's true goal—which
made it clear that he was going on only
from the wish to speak to her. He had to go on,
for this purpose, to High Street, Kensington, as
it was not till then that the exit of a passenger gave
him his chance.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>They found themselves staring directly at each other, for longer than usual, even at social gatherings. But that wouldn't have been a big deal on its own. The important part was that something else was happening too. It wasn't just that their eyes met; their minds, their senses, their deeper selves connected as well. Later, when Kate thought back on this intense moment, she saw it as a specific, significant event.</i></p><p><i>She imagined it like this: She had seen a ladder leaning against a garden wall and decided to climb it to look over into the garden. When she reached the top, she found herself face-to-face with a man who was doing the same thing. They remained, perched on their ladders, looking at each other.

And for a while afterwards, Kate at least, felt like she was still perched up there, unable to retreat.</i></p><p><i>A simpler way of putting it is that they were genuinely interested in each other. If it weren't for a stroke of luck six months later, the whole thing would have ended there. The coincidence, however, was about as common as anything in London: One afternoon, Kate found herself sitting across from Mr. Densher on the subway. She got on at Sloane Square, heading towards Queen's Road, and the car she chose was almost full. Densher was already there, sitting across the aisle at the far end. She knew it was him even before the train started moving. It was dark outside, and there were six other people in the car, but her attention immediately went to him. It was as if they had met in the middle of a desert.</i></p><p><i>Neither of them hesitated for a second. They looked at each other across the crowded car as if she knew he'd be there and he was expecting her. Even though they could only exchange glances, smiles, and silence in that situation, it would have made sense if they had gotten off at the very next station just to talk. In fact, Kate was sure that the next station was actually his destination, which showed that he was only staying on the train to speak to her. He had to ride on to High Street, Kensington, because only then did someone get off the train, giving him the chance to talk to her.</i></p></div>

His chance put him, however, in quick possession
of the seat facing her, the alertness of his capture
of which seemed to show her his impatience.
It helped them, moreover, with strangers on either
side, little to talk; though this very restriction perhaps
made such a mark for them as nothing else
could have done. If the fact that their opportunity
had again come round for them could be so intensely
expressed between them without a word,
they might very well feel on the spot that it had
not come round for nothing. The extraordinary
part of the matter was that they were not in the
least meeting where they had left off, but ever so
much further on, and that these added links added
still another between High Street and Notting Hill
Gate, and then between the latter station and
Queen's Road an extension really inordinate. At
Notting Hill Gate, Kate's right-hand neighbour
descended, whereupon Densher popped straight
into that seat; only there was not much gained
when a lady, the next instant, popped into Densher's.
He could say almost nothing to her—she
scarce knew, at least, what he said; she was so occupied
with a certainty that one of the persons
opposite, a youngish man with a single eyeglass,
which he kept constantly in position, had made her
out from the first as visibly, as strangely affected.
If such a person made her out, what then did
Densher do?—a question in truth sufficiently answered
when, on their reaching her station, he instantly
followed her out of the train. That had
been the real beginning—the beginning of everything
else; the other time, the time at the party,
had been but the beginning of <i>that.</i> Never in life
before had she so let herself go; for always before—so
far as small adventures could have been in
question for her—there had been, by the vulgar
measure, more to go upon. He had walked
with her to Lancaster Gate, and then she had
walked with him away from it—for all the world,
she said to herself, like the housemaid giggling to
the baker.

But it didn't really help, because another woman took Densher's seat right away. He could barely talk to her—she barely understood what he was saying. She was preoccupied, certain that a young man across from her, wearing a monocle, had seen how visibly and strangely affected she was from the beginning.</i></p><p><i>If that man saw through her, what about Densher? The question was answered when he followed her off the train at her station. That was the real beginning—the beginning of everything. Their previous encounter at the party had only been the start of that. Never before had she let herself go so completely. Previously, if she'd had any small adventures, she’d had more to work with, by ordinary standards. He'd walked with her to Lancaster Gate, and then she’d walked away with him – she thought to herself, like a housemaid giggling with the baker.</i></p></div>

<p>
This appearance, she was afterwards to feel, had
been all in order for a relation that might precisely
best be described in the terms of the baker and the
housemaid. She could say to herself that from that
hour they had kept company; that had come to
represent, technically speaking, alike the range and
the limit of their tie. He had on the spot, naturally,
asked leave to call upon her—which, as a young
person who wasn't really young, who didn't pretend
to be a sheltered flower, she as rationally gave.
That—she was promptly clear about it—was now
her only possible basis; she was just the contemporary
London female, highly modern, inevitably
battered, honourably free. She had of course taken
her aunt straight into her confidence—had gone
through the form of asking her leave; and she subsequently
remembered that though, on this occasion,
she had left the history of her new alliance as
scant as the facts themselves, Mrs. Lowder had
struck her at the time surprisingly mild. It had
been, in every way, the occasion, full of the reminder
that her hostess was deep: it was definitely
then that she had begun to ask herself what Aunt
Maud was, in vulgar parlance, "up to." "You
may receive, my dear, whom you like"—that was
what Aunt Maud, who in general objected to people's
doing as they liked, had replied; and it bore,
this unexpectedness, a good deal of looking into.
There were many explanations, and they were all
amusing—amusing, that is, in the line of the sombre
and brooding amusement, cultivated by Kate in
her actual high retreat. Merton Densher came the
very next Sunday; but Mrs. Lowder was so consistently
magnanimous as to make it possible to
her niece to see him alone. She saw him, however,
on the Sunday following, in order to invite him to
dinner; and when, after dining, he came again—which
he did three times, she found means to treat
his visit as preponderantly to herself. Kate's conviction
that she didn't like him made that remarkable;
it added to the evidence, by this time voluminous,
that she was remarkable all round. If she
had been, in the way of energy, merely usual, she
would have kept her dislike direct; whereas it was
now as if she were seeking to know him in order to
see best where to "have" him. That was one of
the reflections made in our young woman's high
retreat; she smiled from her lookout, in the silence
that was only the fact of hearing irrelevant sounds,
as she caught the truth that you could easily accept
people when you wanted them so to be delivered
to you. When Aunt Maud wished them despatched,
it was not to be done by deputy; it was
clearly always a matter reserved for her own hand.
But what made the girl wonder most was the
implications of so much diplomacy in respect to her
own value. What view might she take of her position
in the light of this appearance that her companion
feared so, as yet, to upset her? It was as
if Densher were accepted partly under the dread
that if he hadn't been she would act in resentment.
Hadn't her aunt considered the danger that she
would in that case have broken off, have seceded?
The danger was exaggerated—she would have done
nothing so gross; but that, it seemed, was the way
Mrs. Lowder saw her and believed her to be reckoned
with. What importance therefore did she
really attach to her, what strange interest could
she take on their keeping on terms? Her father and
her sister had their answer to this—even without
knowing how the question struck her; they saw
the lady of Lancaster Gate as panting to make her
fortune, and the explanation of that appetite was
that, on the accident of a nearer view than she had
before enjoyed, she had been charmed, been dazzled.
They approved, they admired in her one of the
belated fancies of rich, capricious, violent old women—the
more marked, moreover, because the result
of no plot; and they piled up the possible results
for the person concerned. Kate knew what to think
of her own power thus to carry by storm; she saw
herself as handsome, no doubt, but as hard, and
felt herself as clever but as cold; and as so much
too imperfectly ambitious, furthermore, that it was
a pity, for a quiet life, she couldn't settle to be
either finely or stupidly indifferent. Her intelligence
sometimes kept her still—too still—but her
want of it was restless; so that she got the good,
it seemed to her, of neither extreme. She saw herself
at present, none the less, in a situation, and
even her sad, disillusioned mother, dying, but with
Aunt Maud interviewing the nurse on the stairs,
had not failed to remind her that it was of the
essence of situations to be, under Providence,
worked. The dear woman had died in the belief
that she was actually working the one then produced.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She realized later that this initial meeting was the start of a relationship best described as a straightforward, almost transactional, arrangement. She could tell herself that from that moment on, they were seeing each other, which, technically speaking, defined both the scope and the limitations of their connection. He immediately asked if he could call on her, which she, being a woman who wasn't really young and wasn't pretending to be naive, rationally allowed. That, she was instantly clear about, was now her only possible foundation; she was just a modern, independent London woman, inevitably experienced, and honorably free. She had, of course, immediately confided in her aunt and asked for her permission; and she later remembered that, although on this occasion she kept the details of her new relationship brief, Mrs. Lowder had been surprisingly agreeable. It was an instance that emphasized how insightful her hostess was; it was then that she began to wonder what Aunt Maud was, in common terms, "up to." "You may see anyone you like, my dear" – that's what Aunt Maud, who usually didn't allow people to do as they pleased, had replied; and this unexpected response was worth further investigation. There were many explanations, all amusing—amusing, that is, in the way of a thoughtful, almost cynical amusement, that Kate cultivated in her private reflection. Merton Densher came the very next Sunday; but Mrs. Lowder was consistently gracious, which allowed her niece to see him alone. However, she saw him the following Sunday to invite him to dinner; and when, after dining, he came again – which he did three times – she made sure his visits were mainly for her. Kate's conviction that she didn't like him was noteworthy; it added to the growing evidence that she was a remarkable person in general. If she had been, in terms of her personality, ordinary, she would have directly expressed her dislike; instead, it was as if she were trying to get to know him to figure out how to "use" him. That was one of the thoughts that arose during our young woman's reflection; she smiled from her vantage point, in the silence, which was only the sound of irrelevant noises, as she realized that you could easily accept people when you wanted them to be in your control. When Aunt Maud wanted them gone, it was never to be done by someone else; it was always clearly something she took care of herself. But what made the girl wonder most was the significance of all this planning concerning her own worth. What should she think about her position, considering this behavior that her companion seemed so afraid to disrupt? It was as if Densher was being accepted partly out of fear that if he wasn't, she would react with resentment. Hadn't her aunt considered the risk that she would have broken off the relationship, have left? The danger was exaggerated—she wouldn't have done anything so extreme; but that, it seemed, was how Mrs. Lowder saw her and believed she had to be taken seriously. How important was she, then, to Mrs. Lowder? What strange interest could she possibly have in their maintaining the relationship? Her father and sister had their answer to this—even without knowing how she felt about it; they saw the woman of Lancaster Gate as eager to secure her own wealth, and the explanation for that desire was that, having gotten closer to her than before, she was charmed, dazzled. They approved, they admired in her one of the late-life fascinations of rich, unpredictable, powerful old women – all the more remarkable because it wasn't the result of any plan; and they listed the possible benefits for the person involved. Kate knew what to think of her own ability to win over people so quickly; she saw herself as attractive, no doubt, but also as tough, and felt herself as clever but cold; and as not ambitious enough, moreover, so that it was a shame, for the sake of a quiet life, she couldn't bring herself to be either subtly or foolishly indifferent. Her intelligence sometimes kept her still—too still—but her lack of it was restless; so that she felt she didn't get the advantage of either extreme. She saw herself now, nonetheless, in a situation, and even her sad, disillusioned mother, dying, but with Aunt Maud questioning the nurse on the stairs, had not failed to remind her that situations had to be worked, with God's help. The dear woman had died believing that she was actually working the one then unfolding.</i></p></div>

Kate took one of her walks with Densher just
after her visit to Mr. Croy; but most of it went, as
usual, to their sitting in talk. They had, under the
trees, by the lake, the air of old friends—phases of
apparent earnestness, in particular, in which they
might have been settling every question in their vast
young world; and periods of silence, side by side,
perhaps even more, when "a long engagement!"
would have been the final reading of the signs on
the part of a passer struck with them, as it was so
easy to be. They would have presented themselves
thus as very old friends rather than as young persons
who had met for the first time but a year before
and had spent most of the interval without
contact. It was indeed for each, already, as if they
were older friends; and though the succession of
their meetings might, between them, have been
straightened out, they only had a confused sense
of a good many, very much alike, and a confused
intention of a good many more, as little different
as possible. The desire to keep them just as they
were had perhaps to do with the fact that in spite
of the presumed diagnosis of the stranger there had
been for them as yet no formal, no final understanding.
Densher had at the very first pressed the question,
but that, it had been easy to reply, was too
soon; so that a singular thing had afterwards happened.
They had accepted their acquaintance as
too short for an engagement, but they had treated
it as long enough for almost anything else, and
marriage was somehow before them like a temple
without an avenue. They belonged to the temple
and they met in the grounds; they were in the
stage at which grounds in general offered much
scattered refreshment. But Kate had meanwhile
had so few confidants that she wondered at the
source of her father's suspicions. The diffusion of
rumour was of course, in London, remarkable, and
for Marian not less—as Aunt Maud touched neither
directly—the mystery had worked. No doubt she
had been seen. Of course she had been seen. She
had taken no trouble not to be seen, and it was
a thing, clearly, she was incapable of taking. But
she had been seen how?—and <i>what</i> was there to see?
She was in love—she knew that: but it was wholly
her own business, and she had the sense of having
conducted herself, of still so doing, with almost
violent conformity.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate went for a walk with Densher shortly after her visit with Mr. Croy. However, most of their time was spent, as usual, talking. They sat under the trees by the lake, acting like old friends. There were moments of serious discussion, where they might have appeared to be resolving all the big issues in their young lives. Then there were long periods of silence together, which might have led an observer to conclude, "They've been engaged forever!"—it was that easy to assume. They seemed more like very old friends than young people who had only met a year ago and spent most of that time apart. In fact, it already felt that way to each of them. Although they could have easily traced the chronology of their meetings, they mostly had a jumbled memory of a lot of them, all very similar, and a vague plan to have many more, just as unremarkable. Their wish to keep things the same might have been related to the fact that, despite what an outsider might assume, they still hadn't had a formal, final agreement. Densher had brought up the question right away, but Kate had easily replied that it was too soon. After that, a strange thing had happened. They considered their relationship too new for engagement, but they treated it as if it were long enough for almost anything else. Marriage was somehow just out of reach, like a temple without a path to it. They belonged to the temple and they met on the grounds. They were at a stage where the grounds offered many enjoyable, scattered experiences. But Kate had so few confidantes that she was puzzled about how her father had become suspicious. Rumors spread quickly in London, and it was the same for Marian, especially since Aunt Maud never directly interfered—the mystery had worked. No doubt she had been seen with Densher. Of course she had been seen. She hadn't tried to hide, and clearly, she was incapable of doing so. But how had she been seen?—And what was there to see? She was in love—she knew that. But it was entirely her own business, and she felt that she had behaved, and was still behaving, with almost excessive discretion.</i></p></div>

"Well," said Kate after an instant, "her idea of
that is what you'll have from her." He gave her
a long look, and whatever else people who wouldn't
let her alone might have wished, for her advancement,
his long looks were the thing in the world
she could never have enough of. What she felt was
that, whatever might happen, she must keep them,
must make them most completely her possession;
and it was already strange enough that she reasoned,
or at all events began to act, as if she might work
them in with other and alien things, privately cherish
them, and yet, as regards the rigour of it, pay
no price. She looked it well in the face, she took
it intensely home, that they were lovers; she rejoiced
to herself and, frankly, to him, in their wearing
of the name; but, distinguished creature that,
in her way, she was, she took a view of this character
that scarce squared with the conventional. The
character itself she insisted on as their right, taking
that so for granted that it didn't seem even bold;
but Densher, though he agreed with her, found
himself moved to wonder at her simplifications, her
values. Life might prove difficult—was evidently
going to; but meanwhile they had each other, and
that was everything. This was her reasoning, but
meanwhile, for <i>him,</i> each other was what they didn't
have, and it was just the point. Repeatedly, however,
it was a point that, in the face of strange and
special things, he judged it rather awkwardly gross
to urge. It was impossible to keep Mrs. Lowder
out of their scheme. She stood there too close to
it and too solidly; it had to open a gate, at a given
point, do what they would to take her in. And she
came in, always, while they sat together rather helplessly
watching her, as in a coach-in-four; she drove
round their prospect as the principal lady at the
circus drives round the ring, and she stopped the
coach in the middle to alight with majesty. It was
our young man's sense that she was magnificently
vulgar, but yet, quite, that this wasn't all. It wasn't
with her vulgarity that she felt his want of means,
though that might have helped her richly to embroider
it; nor was it with the same infirmity that
she was strong, original, dangerous.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Well," Kate said after a moment, "her idea of all this is what you'll get from her." He looked at her intently, and whatever else people who wanted her to succeed might have wished for, her ability to make him look at her like that was the most important thing in the world to her. What she felt was that, no matter what happened, she had to keep those looks, had to make them completely hers; and it was already strange enough that she was thinking, or at least beginning to act, as if she could incorporate them with other things, secretly treasure them, and yet, in terms of consequences, not have to pay anything. She fully understood that they were lovers; she reveled in that fact, both to herself and frankly to him, and they openly used the term. But, being the unique person she was, she approached this relationship in a way that was unconventional. She insisted on having this relationship as their right, taking it for granted in a way that didn't even seem daring; but Densher, though he agreed with her, found himself surprised by her simplifications, her values. Life might become difficult—it obviously would—but in the meantime they had each other, and that was all that mattered. This was her reasoning, but for him, in the meantime, they didn't really *have* each other, and that was the problem. However, he kept finding that, in the face of their strange situation, it seemed rather insensitive to bring up this point. It was impossible to exclude Mrs. Lowder from their plans. She was too involved and powerful; their plans had to involve her in some way, no matter what. And she *did* get involved, always, while they sat together rather helplessly watching her, as if she were in a horse-drawn carriage; she paraded around their situation like the main figure in a circus, and then stopped the carriage in the middle of it to get out with regal authority. Our young man felt that she was magnificently vulgar, but also that there was more to her than that. It wasn't because of her vulgarity that she was aware of his lack of money, although that might have made her more likely to criticize it; nor was her strength, originality, and danger based on that.</i></p></div>

<p>
His want of means—of means sufficient for anyone
but himself—was really the great ugliness, and
was, moreover, at no time more ugly for him than
when it rose there, as it did seem to rise, shameless,
face to face with the elements in Kate's life
colloquially and conveniently classed by both of
them as funny. He sometimes indeed, for that matter,
asked himself if these elements were as funny
as the innermost fact, so often vivid to him, of his
own consciousness—his private inability to believe
he should ever be rich. His conviction on this head
was in truth quite positive and a thing by itself; he
failed, after analysis, to understand it, though he
had naturally more lights on it than any one else.
He knew how it subsisted in spite of an equal consciousness
of his being neither mentally nor physically
quite helpless, neither a dunce nor a cripple;
he knew it to be absolute, though secret, and also,
strange to say, about common undertakings, not
discouraging, not prohibitive. Only now was he
having to think if it were prohibitive in respect to
marriage; only now, for the first time, had he to
weigh his case in scales. The scales, as he sat with
Kate, often dangled in the line of his vision; he
saw them, large and black, while he talked or listened,
take, in the bright air, singular positions.
Sometimes the right was down and sometimes the
left; never a happy equipoise—one or the other
always kicking the beam. Thus was kept before
him the question of whether it were more ignoble
to ask a woman to take her chance with you, or to
accept it from one's conscience that her chance
could be at the best but one of the degrees of privation;
whether, too, otherwise, marrying for money
mightn't after all be a smaller cause of shame than
the mere dread of marrying without. Through
these variations of mood and view, all the same, the
mark on his forehead stood clear; he saw himself
remain without whether he married or not. It was
a line on which his fancy could be admirably active;
the innumerable ways of making money were beautifully
present to him; he could have handled them,
for his newspaper, as easily as he handled everything.
He was quite aware how he handled everything;
it was another mark on his forehead; the
pair of smudges from the thumb of fortune, the
brand on the passive fleece, dated from the primal
hour and kept each other company. He wrote, as
for print, with deplorable ease; since there had been
nothing to stop him even at the age of ten, so
there was as little at twenty; it was part of his fate
in the first place and part of the wretched public's
in the second. The innumerable ways of making
money were, no doubt, at all events, what his imagination
often was busy with after he had tilted
his chair and thrown back his head with his hands
clasped behind it. What would most have prolonged
that attitude, moreover, was the reflection
that the ways were ways only for others. Within
the minute, now—however this might be—he was
aware of a nearer view than he had yet quite had
of those circumstances on his companion's part that
made least for simplicity of relation. He saw above
all how she saw them herself, for she spoke of them
at present with the last frankness, telling him of her
visit to her father and giving him, in an account of
her subsequent scene with her sister, an instance of
how she was perpetually reduced to patching up, in
one way or another, that unfortunate woman's
hopes.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>His lack of money—not just enough for him, but enough for anyone—was truly the biggest problem, and it seemed especially ugly to him when it surfaced, shamelessly confronting the "funny" aspects of Kate's life (a description they both used). Sometimes he wondered if those "funny" aspects were actually as funny as the most basic fact he was aware of – his own conviction that he would never be rich. This belief was unwavering and unique to him; he couldn't fully understand it, even though he knew more about it than anyone else. He knew it persisted despite his understanding that he wasn't helpless, either mentally or physically—not stupid, not disabled. He knew this belief was absolute, though hidden, and surprisingly didn't discourage him from common goals. Only now was he forced to consider if it would prevent him from marrying; only now did he have to weigh his situation. The scales, as he sat with Kate, were often in his mind; he pictured them, large and dark, shifting positions as he talked or listened. Sometimes the right side was down, sometimes the left, never a balance—always tipped one way or the other. This forced him to consider whether it was more shameful to ask a woman to risk her future with him, or to acknowledge that, in his conscience, her life with him would involve some level of poverty; whether, also, marrying for money might be less shameful than being too afraid to marry without it. Through these shifting thoughts, the truth remained clear: he knew he would remain poor whether he married or not. He could vividly imagine the many ways to make money, and they were always present in his thoughts; he could write about them for his newspaper as easily as he wrote about anything else. He was very aware of how easily he wrote; it was another mark on him, a sign of his destiny, a constant reminder. He wrote easily, deplorably so; nothing had stopped him, even at age ten, and nothing now at twenty—it was both his fate and the public's. The many ways to make money were what his imagination often focused on when he leaned back in his chair with his hands clasped behind his head. What would prolong that attitude most was realizing that those opportunities were only available to other people. In the moment, however, he was more aware than ever of the complexities in Kate's life that complicated their relationship. He understood how she saw them, because she spoke about them frankly, telling him about her visit to her father and describing a recent argument with her sister, illustrating how she constantly had to repair that unfortunate woman's hopes.</i></p></div>

"The tune," she exclaimed, "to which we're a
failure as a family!" With which he had it again
all from her—and this time, as it seemed to him,
more than all: the dishonour her father had brought
them, his folly and cruelty and wickedness; the
wounded state of her mother, abandoned, despoiled
and helpless, yet, for the management of such a
home as remained to them, dreadfully unreasonable
too; the extinction of her two young brothers—one,
at nineteen, the eldest of the house, by typhoid
fever, contracted at a poisonous little place, as they
had afterwards found out, that they had taken for
a summer; the other, the flower of the flock, a
middy on the <i>Britannia,</i> dreadfully drowned, and
not even by an accident at sea, but by cramp, unrescued,
while bathing, too late in the autumn, in
a wretched little river during a holiday visit to the
home of a shipmate. Then Marian's unnatural marriage,
in itself a kind of spiritless turning of the
other cheek to fortune: her actual wretchedness
and plaintiveness, her greasy children, her impossible
claims, her odious visitors—these things completed
the proof of the heaviness, for them all, of the
hand of fate. Kate confessedly described them with
an excess of impatience; it was much of her charm
for Densher that she gave in general that turn to
her descriptions, partly as if to amuse him by free
and humorous colour, partly—and that charm was
the greatest—as if to work off, for her own relief,
her constant perception of the incongruity of things.
She had seen the general show too early and too
sharply, and she was so intelligent that she knew it
and allowed for that misfortune; therefore when,
in talk with him, she was violent and almost unfeminine,
it was almost as if they had settled, for
intercourse, on the short cut of the fantastic and
the happy language of exaggeration. It had come
to be definite between them at a primary stage that,
if they could have no other straight way, the realm
of thought at least was open to them. They could
think whatever they liked about whatever they
would—or, in other words, they could say it. Saying
it for each other, for each other alone, only
of course added to the taste. The implication was
thereby constant that what they said when not together
had no taste for them at all, and nothing
could have served more to launch them, at special
hours, on their small floating island than such an
assumption that they were only making believe
everywhere else. Our young man, it must be added,
was conscious enough that it was Kate who profited
most by this particular play of the fact of intimacy.
It always seemed to him that she had more life
than he to react from, and when she recounted the
dark disasters of her house and glanced at the hard,
odd offset of her present exaltation—since as exaltation
it was apparently to be considered—he felt
his own grey domestic annals to make little show.
It was naturally, in all such reference, the question
of her father's character that engaged him most,
but her picture of her adventure in Chirk Street
gave him a sense of how little as yet that character
was clear to him. What was it, to speak plainly, that
Mr. Croy had originally done?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"That tune," she declared, "is what makes our family such a mess!" And with that, she unloaded everything on him again—and this time, it seemed to him, even more than before: the shame her father had brought on them, his foolishness, his cruelty, his evil behavior. There was also her mother's broken spirit, abandoned, taken advantage of, and helpless, and yet, also maddeningly difficult to deal with in running what was left of their home. Then there was the loss of her two young brothers—one, the eldest at nineteen, who died of typhoid fever, which he'd caught at a terrible little place they'd rented for the summer; they only found out later how dangerous it was. The other brother, the best of the family, a midshipman on the Britannia, drowned in a horrible way. It wasn't even an accident at sea, but from a cramp while he was swimming, and no one could save him. It happened during a holiday visit to a shipmate's home, late in the autumn, in a wretched little river. And then there was Marian's unnatural marriage, a kind of passive acceptance of bad luck. Her actual misery and complaining, her messy children, her unreasonable demands, her awful visitors—all of this proved just how heavy fate had been on them. Kate readily admitted she could be impatient when describing things, and that was part of her appeal to Densher. She usually added that tone to her stories, partly to entertain him with colorful and humorous language, but mostly—and this was her greatest charm—to release herself from her constant awareness of how absurd things were. She'd seen the bigger picture of life too early and too clearly, and she was intelligent enough to know it and to accept that this was unfortunate. Therefore, when she was angry and almost unladylike in their conversations, it was as if they had agreed to communicate through the shortcut of fantasy and the happy language of exaggeration. They'd established early on that if they couldn't find a direct path in life, at least they had the freedom of thought. They could think whatever they wanted about whatever they wanted—or, in other words, they could say it. Saying it to each other, and to each other alone, of course, made it all the better. The unspoken understanding was that what they said when they weren't together had no meaning for them, and this assumption—that they were just pretending everywhere else—was the perfect way to get them started on their little private island at certain times. Our young man, it should be added, was aware that Kate benefited the most from their intimate conversations. It always seemed to him that she had more to react against, more to cope with in her life. When she recounted the family's dark tragedies and hinted at her current elation—because that's what it seemed to be—he felt his own rather boring life stories didn't compare. Naturally, in all these discussions, he was most interested in her father's character, but her description of her experience in Chirk Street made him realize how little he understood her father. What, to put it simply, had Mr. Croy done in the first place?</i></p></div>

"I don't know—and I don't want to. I only
know that years and years ago—when I was about
fifteen—something or other happened that made
him impossible. I mean impossible for the world at
large first, and then, little by little, for mother. We
of course didn't know it at the time," Kate explained,
"but we knew it later; and it was, oddly
enough, my sister who first made out that he had
done something. I can hear her now—the way,
one cold, black Sunday morning when, on account
of an extraordinary fog, we had not gone to church,
she broke it to me by the school-room fire. I was
reading a history-book by the lamp—when we
didn't go to church we had to read history-books—and
I suddenly heard her say, out of the fog, which
was in the room, and <i>apropos</i> of nothing: 'Papa
has done something wicked.' And the curious thing
was that I believed it on the spot and have believed
it ever since, though she could tell me nothing
more—neither what was the wickedness, nor how
she knew, nor what would happen to him, nor anything
else about it. We had our sense, always, that
all sorts of things <i>had</i> happened, were all the while
happening, to him; so that when Marian only said
she was sure, tremendously sure, that she had made
it out for herself, but that that was enough, I took
her word for it—it seemed somehow so natural.
We were not, however, to ask mother—which made
it more natural still, and I said never a word. But
mother, strangely enough, spoke of it to me, in
time, of her own accord very much later on. He
hadn't been with us for ever so long, but we were
used to that. She must have had some fear, some
conviction that I had an idea, some idea of her own
that it was the best thing to do. She came out as
abruptly as Marian had done: 'If you hear anything
against your father—anything I mean, except that
he's odious and vile—remember it's perfectly false.'
That was the way I knew—it was true, though I
recall that I said to her then that I of course knew
it wasn't. She might have told me it was true, and
yet have trusted me to contradict fiercely enough
any accusation of him that I should meet—to contradict
it much more fiercely and effectively, I think,
than she would have done herself. As it happens,
however," the girl went on, "I've never had occasion,
and I've been conscious of it with a sort of surprise.
It has made the world, at times, seem more
decent. No one has so much as breathed to me.
That has been a part of the silence, the silence that
surrounds him, the silence that, for the world, has
washed him out. He doesn't exist for people.
And yet I'm as sure as ever. In fact, though I know
no more than I did then, I'm more sure. And that,"
she wound up, "is what I sit here and tell you about
my own father. If you don't call it a proof of confidence
I don't know what will satisfy you."
