<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Milly and her companion, Susie Stringham, are at a dinner party at Lancaster Gate, hosted by Mrs. Lowder. Milly is seated next to a gentleman, Lord Mark, and tells him she barely knows where she is. There are twenty people at the table.</p><p>Before dinner, Mrs. Lowder's niece, Kate Croy, introduced Lord Mark to Milly, and he escorted her to the table. During the meal, Milly observes Kate across the table, and their eyes meet.</p><p>Milly and Lord Mark have a long conversation. He tells her that London society has no real "sets," calls Mrs. Lowder an "extraordinary woman," and says Kate is "tremendously... good-looking." Milly recounts to him that Mrs. Lowder invited them to dine soon after their arrival and visited their hotel with Kate.</p><p>Lord Mark tells Milly that she is a social success and is being "jumped at." He asks what Mrs. Lowder knows about her, and says he will observe what Mrs. Lowder "does with" her. When Milly asks what their hostess knows about him, he says "Nothing," and that Milly is now Mrs. Lowder's best new acquisition. Milly asks what he meant by Mrs. Lowder doing something with her, and he replies that she will "get her money back" because "nobody here, you know, does anything for nothing."</p><p>Milly calls Mrs. Lowder an idealist. She tells Lord Mark that he and the others are familiar with everything but have no imagination. She then asks him what Kate has to gain from being welcoming to her. As she asks, Kate looks over at them. Lord Mark replies that Kate gains Milly’s acquaintance. Milly suggests Kate's motive is pity. Lord Mark says he is not sorry for Milly at all. He admits he does not understand Kate and asks Milly to tell him about her when she knows more. Milly concludes that Kate must be difficult, while she herself is easy.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
Milly is presented as a highly sensitive and observant American, newly thrust into a sophisticated English social scene. Her situation has shifted with dizzying speed from that of a tourist to the center of attention at a formal dinner, leaving her feeling disoriented yet exhilarated. She is acutely conscious of being evaluated, analyzing everyone around her while aware that she herself is being "jumped at." She is prone to seeing her situation in romantic terms ("fairy-tale") but is also immediately perceptive of complex social dynamics and "possibly sinister motive."
<li>*Susie (Mrs. Stringham)**</li>
Milly's companion, Susie, is presented through Milly's eyes as a triumphant "fairy godmother." Her situation has shifted from being a traveling friend to the successful orchestrator of Milly's social debut. She now "glitters" with a sense of success, content with the results of her efforts.
<li>*Lord Mark**</li>
Lord Mark is Milly's dinner partner and is presented as a collection of contradictions: he looks both old and young, seems both "intellectual" and "frivolous," and acts both clever and indifferent. As a member of the aristocracy, he is world-weary and speaks cynically of London society, yet he is also perceptive. He immediately categorizes Milly as a predictable American "type" but also declares her a "success," engaging her in a probing, almost intimate conversation.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Referred to as "the handsome girl," Kate is presented primarily through her striking beauty and "eminence." She is positioned as a figure of great interest and mystery. Though she appears "charming" and "frankly conscious" of friendship, Milly senses she is a complex individual whom even insiders like Lord Mark cannot "make out." Her situation is that of an established social figure who immediately fascinates the newcomer, Milly.
<li>*Mrs. Lowder**</li></ul>
The hostess is presented as a powerful and substantial figure, described as "massive" and a "great reality." Her situation has shifted from being a distant acquaintance of Susie's to the formidable architect of the evening. She is perceived by Milly as an "idealist," but there are immediate hints that she is a pragmatic social operator who is using Lord Mark to assess Milly's "value."
        </div>

<div class="original-text">
<p>
It had all gone so fast after this that Milly uttered
but the truth nearest to hand in saying to the
gentleman on her right—who was, by the same
token, the gentleman on her hostess's left—that she
scarce even then knew where she was: the words
marking her first full sense of a situation really romantic.
They were already dining, she and her
friend, at Lancaster Gate, and surrounded, as it
seemed to her, with every English accessory; though
her consciousness of Mrs. Lowder's existence, and
still more of her remarkable identity, had been of so
recent and so sudden a birth. Susie, as she was apt
to call her companion for a lighter change, had only
had to wave a neat little wand for the fairy-tale to
begin at once; in consequence of which Susie now
glittered—for, with Mrs. Stringham's new sense of
success, it came to that—in the character of a fairy
godmother. Milly had almost insisted on dressing
her, for the present occasion, as one; and it was no
fault of the girl's if the good lady had not now appeared
in a peaked hat, a short petticoat and diamond
shoe-buckles, brandishing the magic crutch.
The good lady, in truth, bore herself not less contentedly
than if these insignia had marked her
work; and Milly's observation to Lord Mark had
just been, doubtless, the result of such a light exchange
of looks with her as even the great length
of the table had not baffled. There were twenty
persons between them, but this sustained passage
was the sharpest sequel yet to that other comparison
of views during the pause on the Swiss pass.
It almost appeared to Milly that their fortune had
been unduly precipitated—as if, properly, they were
in the position of having ventured on a small joke
and found the answer out of proportion grave.
She could not at this moment, for instance, have
said whether, with her quickened perceptions, she
were more enlivened or oppressed; and the case
might in fact have been serious had she not, by
good fortune, from the moment the picture loomed,
quickly made up her mind that what finally most
concerned her was neither to seek nor to shirk,
was not even to wonder too much, but was to let
things come as they would, since there was little
enough doubt of how they would go.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Everything happened so quickly after that that Milly simply blurted out the first thing that came to mind to the man on her right – who also happened to be sitting on her hostess’s left – saying that she hardly even knew where she was. Those words were her first real acknowledgement of how incredibly romantic the situation felt. They were already at dinner, she and her friend, at Lancaster Gate, surrounded, as it seemed to her, by all things English. Even though she’d only just become aware of Mrs. Lowder’s presence, and even more so of her striking personality, it had all happened so suddenly. Susie, as she often called her friend to be more casual, had only had to wave her hand, and the fairytale began at once. As a result, Susie now glowed, because, with Mrs. Stringham’s newfound success, it really came down to that – in the role of a fairy godmother. Milly had almost insisted on dressing her, for this occasion, as one, and it was only through no fault of Susie’s that the good lady wasn’t currently wearing a pointed hat, a short petticoat, diamond shoe buckles, and waving a magic crutch.</i></p><p><i>In truth, the good lady seemed as pleased as if she were wearing those things to signify her efforts. Milly’s comment to Lord Mark had surely been prompted by a quick exchange of glances with Susie, a connection that the long table hadn’t managed to interrupt. Even though there were twenty people between them, this subtle conversation was the most obvious result of their earlier discussion while they paused on the Swiss pass.</i></p><p><i>Milly almost felt as though their fortunes had been rushed, as if they’d made a small joke and received a disproportionately serious response. She couldn’t say at that moment, with her sharper awareness, whether she was more excited or overwhelmed. It might actually have been a serious issue, if she hadn’t, luckily, decided from the moment the situation became clear that the most important thing was neither to seek nor to avoid, not even to overthink it. Instead, she chose to let things unfold as they would, since she had little doubt how they would turn out.</i></p></div>

<p>
Lord Mark had been brought to her before dinner—not
by Mrs. Lowder, but by the handsome
girl, that lady's niece, who was now at the other
end and on the same side as Susie; he had taken
her in, and she meant presently to ask him about
Miss Croy, the handsome girl, actually offered to
her sight—though now in a splendid way—but for
the second time. The first time had been the occasion—only
three days before—of her calling at
their hotel with her aunt and then making, for our
other two heroines, a great impression of beauty
and eminence. This impression had remained so
with Milly that, at present, and although her attention
was aware at the same time of everything
else, her eyes were mainly engaged with Kate
Croy when not engaged with Susie. That wonderful
creature's eyes moreover readily met them—she
ranked now as a wonderful creature; and
it seemed a part of the swift prosperity of the
American visitors that, so little in the original reckoning,
she should yet appear conscious, charmingly,
frankly conscious, of possibilities of friendship for
them. Milly had easily and, as a guest, gracefully
generalised: English girls had a special, strong
beauty, and it particularly showed in evening dress—above
all when, as was strikingly the case with
this one, the dress itself was what it should be.
That observation she had all ready for Lord Mark
when they should, after a little, get round to it.
She seemed even now to see that there might be a
good deal they would get round to; the indication
being that, taken up once for all with her other
neighbour, their hostess would leave them much to
themselves. Mrs. Lowder's other neighbour was
the Bishop of Murrum—a real bishop, such as Milly
had never seen, with a complicated costume, a voice
like an old-fashioned wind instrument, and a face
all the portrait of a prelate; while the gentleman on
our young lady's left, a gentleman thick-necked,
large and literal, who looked straight before him
and as if he were not to be diverted by vain words
from that pursuit, clearly counted as an offset to
the possession of Lord Mark. As Milly made out
these things—with a shade of exhilaration at the
way she already fell in—she saw how she was justified
of her plea for people and her love of life. It
wasn't then, as the prospect seemed to show, so difficult
to get into the current, or to stand, at any
rate, on the bank. It was easy to get near—if they
<i>were</i> near; and yet the elements were different
enough from any of her old elements, and positively
rich and strange.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Lord Mark had been introduced to her before dinner—not by Mrs. Lowder, but by the beautiful girl, Mrs. Lowder's niece, who was now seated at the far end of the table on the same side as Susie. He had escorted her to her seat, and Milly intended to ask him about Miss Croy, the attractive girl who was actually present—though in a glamorous way—for the second time. The first time had been just three days earlier, when she and her aunt had visited their hotel and made a strong impression of beauty and importance on the other two women. This impression had remained so strong with Milly that, even though she was aware of everything else happening, her attention was mostly focused on Kate Croy when she wasn't looking at Susie. That stunning woman's eyes readily met hers—she now seemed to be a truly remarkable person; and it seemed to be part of the American visitors' quick rise to success that, despite being so unexpected, she appeared aware, charmingly and openly, of the possibility of becoming friends with them. Milly had easily and gracefully generalized, as a guest does: English girls had a special, strong beauty, and it was particularly evident in evening gowns—especially when, as was very clear in this case, the dress itself was perfect. She already had that observation prepared to share with Lord Mark when they eventually got around to talking about it. She even felt that there might be a lot they would end up discussing; the implication being that their hostess, already absorbed with her other dinner partner, would leave them to themselves. Mrs. Lowder's other dinner partner was the Bishop of Murrum—a real bishop, the likes of whom Milly had never seen, with a complex outfit, a voice like an old-fashioned wind instrument, and a face straight out of a portrait of a prelate. Meanwhile, the gentleman on Milly's left, a thick-necked, large, and literal man who stared straight ahead and as if he couldn't be distracted by idle conversation from his own thoughts, seemed to balance out the presence of Lord Mark. As Milly understood all of this—with a touch of excitement at how easily she was fitting in—she realized that her faith in people and her love of life were justified. It wasn't as difficult as it seemed to get involved, or at least to stay on the periphery. It was easy to get close—if they were close; and yet the whole environment was different from anything she was used to, and positively rich and strange.</i></p></div>

She asked herself if her right-hand neighbour
would understand what she meant by such a description
of them, should she throw it off; but another
of the things to which, precisely, her sense
was awakened was that no, decidedly, he wouldn't.
It was nevertheless by this time open to her that
his line would be to be clever; and indeed, evidently,
no little of the interest was going to be in
the fresh reference and fresh effect both of people's
cleverness and of their simplicity. She thrilled, she
consciously flushed, and turned pale with the certitude—it
had never been so present—that she
should find herself completely involved: the very
air of the place, the pitch of the occasion, had for
her so positive a taste and so deep an undertone.
The smallest things, the faces, the hands, the jewels
of the women, the sound of words, especially of
names, across the table, the shape of the forks, the
arrangement of the flowers, the attitude of the servants,
the walls of the room, were all touches in a
picture and denotements in a play; and they marked
for her, moreover, her alertness of vision. She had
never, she might well believe, been in such a state
of vibration; her sensibility was almost too sharp
for her comfort: there were, for example, more indications
than she could reduce to order in the manner
of the friendly niece, who struck her as distinguished
and interesting, as in fact surprisingly
genial. This young woman's type had, visibly,
other possibilities; yet here, of its own free movement,
it had already sketched a relation. Were
they, Miss Croy and she, to take up the tale where
their two elders had left it off so many years before?—were
they to find they liked each other and to
try for themselves if a scheme of constancy on more
modern lines could be worked? She had doubted,
as they came to England, of Maud Manningham,
had believed her a broken reed and a vague resource,
had seen their dependence on her as a state
of mind that would have been shamefully silly—so
far as it <i>was</i> dependence—had they wished to do
any thing so inane as "get into society." To have
made their pilgrimage all for the sake of such society
as Mrs. Lowder might have in reserve for them—that
didn't bear thinking of at all, and she herself
had quite chosen her course for curiosity about
other matters. She would have described this curiosity
as a desire to see the places she had read about,
and <i>that</i> description of her motive she was prepared
to give her neighbour—even though, as a consequence
of it, he should find how little she had read.
It was almost at present as if her poor prevision had
been rebuked by the majesty—she could scarcely
call it less—of the event, or at all events by the commanding
character of the two figures—she could
scarcely call <i>that</i> less either—mainly presented.
Mrs. Lowder and her niece, however dissimilar, had
at least in common that each was a great reality.
That was true, primarily, of the aunt—so true that
Milly wondered how her own companion had arrived,
in other days, at so odd an alliance; yet she
none the less felt Mrs. Lowder as a person of whom
the mind might in two or three days roughly make
the circuit. She would sit there massive, at least,
while one attempted it; whereas Miss Croy, the
handsome girl, would indulge in incalculable movements
that might interfere with one's tour. She
was real, none the less, and everything and everybody
were real; and it served them right, no doubt,
the pair of them, for having rushed into their adventure.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She wondered if the person sitting next to her would understand what she was implying if she were to say it out loud. But, the thing that was really clear to her was that, no, definitely not, he wouldn't. Nevertheless, she now realized that he would probably try to be witty. And in fact, it seemed as if a lot of the excitement would come from the new meaning and impact of both people's cleverness and their simplicity. She felt a thrill, she blushed and then went pale with the certainty – which had never been so clear – that she would be totally caught up in it all. The atmosphere of the place, the nature of the event, had a very specific flavor and a deep underlying tone for her.</i></p><p><i>The smallest things – the faces, the hands, the women's jewelry, the sound of words, especially names, spoken across the table, the shape of the forks, the flower arrangements, the servers’ demeanor, the walls of the room – were all details in a painting and clues in a play. They also showed her how alert she was. She had never, she believed, been in such a heightened state of awareness. Her sensitivity was almost too intense for her comfort. For example, there were more things than she could easily organize in the manner of the friendly niece, who struck her as sophisticated and interesting, in fact, surprisingly warm and friendly. This young woman’s personality had, obviously, other potential directions, but here, she had already established a connection.</i></p><p><i>Were she and Miss Croy going to pick up where their elders had left off so many years ago? Were they going to discover that they liked each other and see if they could make a modern version of a lasting relationship? She had doubted Maud Manningham when they came to England, thinking of her as unreliable and a vague resource. She had seen their reliance on her as a shameful and silly state – if it could be called reliance – if they had wanted to do something as foolish as "get into society." To have made their trip only for the sake of the kind of society Mrs. Lowder might have to offer – that was not even worth considering, and she herself had chosen her path out of curiosity about other things. She would have described this curiosity as a desire to see the places she had read about, and she was prepared to tell her neighbor that, even if it meant he'd see how little she had read.</i></p><p><i>It was almost as if her previous doubts had been challenged by the grandeur – she could hardly call it less – of the event, or at least by the commanding presence of the two main figures – she could hardly call them less either. Mrs. Lowder and her niece, however different, at least had one thing in common: they were both very real. That was especially true of the aunt – so true that Milly wondered how her friend had formed such a strange alliance in the past. Yet she still felt Mrs. Lowder was someone whose mind she could quickly get to know in a few days. She would sit there, imposing at least, while one tried to understand her. Miss Croy, the beautiful girl, would engage in unpredictable actions that could disrupt one's analysis. She was real, nonetheless, and everything and everyone was real. And no doubt, that was good for them, for having jumped into their adventure.</i></p></div>

Lord Mark's intelligence meanwhile, however,
had met her own quite sufficiently to enable him to
tell her how little he could clear up her situation.
He explained, for that matter—or at least he hinted—that
there was no such thing, to-day in London,
as saying where any one was. Every one was
everywhere—nobody was anywhere. He should
be put to it—yes, frankly—to give a name of any
sort or kind to their hostess's "set." <i>Was</i> it a set
at all, or wasn't it, and were there not really no such
things as sets, in the place, any more?—was there
any thing but the senseless shifting tumble, like
that of some great greasy sea in mid-Channel, of
an overwhelming melted mixture? He threw out
the question, which seemed large; Milly felt that
at the end of five minutes he had thrown out a great
many, though he followed none more than a step or
two; perhaps he would prove suggestive, but he
helped her as yet to no discriminations: he spoke
as if he had given them up from too much knowledge.
He was thus at the opposite extreme from
herself, but, as a consequence of it, also wandering
and lost; and he was furthermore, for all his temporary
incoherence, to which she guessed there
would be some key, as great a reality as either Mrs.
Lowder or Kate. The only light in which he
placed the former of these ladies was that of
an extraordinary woman—a most extraordinary
woman, and "the more extraordinary the more one
knows her," while of the latter he said nothing, for
the moment, but that she was tremendously, yes,
quite tremendously, good-looking. It was some
time, she thought, before his talk showed his cleverness,
and yet each minute she believed in it more,
quite apart from what her hostess had told her on
first naming him. Perhaps he was one of the cases
she had heard of at home—those characteristic
cases of people in England who concealed their play
of mind so much more than they showed it. Even
Mr. Densher a little did that. And what made Lord
Mark, at any rate, so real either, when this was a
thing he so definitely insisted on? His type some
how, as by a life, a need, an intention of its own, insisted
<i>for</i> him; but that was all. It was difficult to
guess his age—whether he were a young man who
looked old or an old man who looked young; it
seemed to prove nothing, as against other things,
that he was bald and, as might have been said,
slightly stale, or, more delicately perhaps, dry:
there was such a fine little fidget of preoccupied life
in him, and his eyes, at moments—though it was an
appearance they could suddenly lose—were as candid
and clear as those of a pleasant boy. Very neat,
very light, and so fair that there was little other indication
of his moustache than his constantly feeling
it—which was again boyish—he would have
affected her as the most intellectual person present
if he had not affected her as the most frivolous.
The latter quality was rather in his look than in anything
else, though he constantly wore his double
eyeglass, which was, much more, Bostonian and
thoughtful.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Meanwhile, Lord Mark's intelligence had matched Milly's well enough for him to make it clear that he couldn't clarify her situation much. In fact—or at least, he implied—that in modern London, you couldn't actually pinpoint where anyone was. Everyone was everywhere; nobody was truly anywhere. He’d struggle, frankly, to even define their hostess's social circle. Was it a "set" at all, or not? Were actual social circles even a thing anymore? Was it just a chaotic, ever-shifting mess, like a churning, greasy sea in the middle of the Channel? He posed the question, which seemed significant. Milly felt he'd posed a lot of questions in five minutes, though he didn't follow up on any of them closely. He might be thought-provoking, but he wasn't helping her understand anything yet. He spoke as though he'd given up on understanding things because he knew too much.</i></p><p><i>He was the complete opposite of her, but as a result, he was also lost and uncertain. Despite his temporary incoherence, which she suspected had some meaning, he felt as real as either Mrs. Lowder or Kate. The only way he described Mrs. Lowder was as an extraordinary woman – a most extraordinary woman, and "the more extraordinary, the more you get to know her." He didn't say anything about Kate at that moment, except that she was incredibly, undeniably attractive. Milly thought it took a while for his intelligence to shine through his conversation, yet she believed in it more with each passing minute, regardless of what her hostess had initially told her about him. Perhaps he was one of those people she'd heard about back home – those typical English types who hid their intelligence more than they showed it. Even Mr. Densher did that, a little bit. And what made Lord Mark so real, especially when he insisted on it so strongly? His "type" somehow, as if driven by some internal need and purpose, asserted itself, but that was all. It was hard to guess his age—was he a young man who looked old or an old man who looked young? The fact that he was bald and, perhaps, slightly worn-out or, more delicately, dry, seemed to prove nothing. He had such a subtle, restless energy about him, and his eyes, at times—though it was an appearance they could lose suddenly—were as open and clear as a pleasant boy's. He was very neat, very light-featured, and fair-skinned. His mustache was barely visible, except for the fact that he was constantly touching it, a boyish habit. He would have seemed like the most intellectual person in the room, if he hadn't also seemed like the most frivolous. The latter quality was more apparent in his demeanor than anything else, although he always wore his double eyeglass, which, ironically, made him appear more like a thoughtful Bostonian.</i></p></div>

The idea of his frivolity had, no doubt, to do with
his personal designation, which represented—as yet,
for our young woman, a little confusedly—a connection
with an historic patriciate, a class that, in
turn, also confusedly, represented an affinity with a
social element that she had never heard otherwise
described than as "fashion." The supreme social
element in New York had never known itself but
as reduced to that category, and though Milly was
aware that, as applied to a territorial and political
aristocracy, the label was probably too simple, she
had for the time none other at hand. She presently,
it is true, enriched her idea with the perception
that her interlocutor was indifferent; yet this, indifferent
as aristocracies notoriously were, saw her but
little further, inasmuch as she felt that, in the first
place, he would much rather get on with her than
not, and in the second was only thinking of too
many matters of his own. If he kept her in view
on the one hand and kept so much else on the other—the
way he crumbed up his bread was a proof—why
did he hover before her as a potentially insolent
noble? She couldn't have answered the question,
and it was precisely one of those that swarmed.
They were complicated, she might fairly have said,
by his visibly knowing, having known from afar off,
that she was a stranger and an American, and by
his none the less making no more of it than if she
and her like were the chief of his diet. He took
her, kindly enough, but imperturbably, irreclaimably,
for granted, and it wouldn't in the least help
that she herself knew him, as quickly, for having
been in her country and threshed it out. There
would be nothing for her to explain or attenuate
or brag about; she could neither escape nor prevail
by her strangeness; he would have, for that matter,
on such a subject, more to tell her than to learn
from her. She might learn from <i>him</i> why she was
so different from the handsome girl—which she
didn't know, being merely able to feel it; or at any
rate might learn from him why the handsome girl
was so different from her.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>His reputation for being frivolous probably stemmed from his title. For Milly, who was still trying to figure things out, that title seemed to connect him to a historical upper class. That class, in turn, also somewhat vaguely, represented a connection to something she only knew as "fashion." New York's elite society only understood itself in those terms. Even though Milly knew that label was probably too simplistic for a hereditary aristocracy, she didn't have a better one at the moment. She soon realized that he seemed indifferent, and although aristocrats were notoriously so, it didn't really help her understand him better. She felt, first, that he actually enjoyed her company, and second, that he was preoccupied with his own thoughts.</i></p><p><i>If he was keeping her in mind, while also dealing with so much else – the way he crumbled his bread was a clue – then why did he present himself as a potentially arrogant nobleman? She couldn't answer that question, and it was just one of many that were swirling around in her mind. They were made more complex, she realized, by the fact that he clearly knew she was a foreigner and an American, but he didn't seem to care any more than if she and people like her were the main focus of his attention. He accepted her, kindly enough, but also with an unwavering, undeniable assumption that she belonged there. And it wouldn't help that she, too, had quickly realized he'd spent time in her country and understood it.</i></p><p><i>There would be nothing for her to explain, downplay, or boast about. She couldn't use her foreignness to escape or gain an advantage. On that topic, he would likely have more to tell her than to learn from her.

On these lines, however, they would move later;
the lines immediately laid down were, in spite of his
vagueness for his own convenience, definite enough.
She was already, he observed to her, thinking what
she should say on her other side—which was what
Americans were always doing. She needn't in conscience
say anything at all; but Americans never
knew that, nor ever, poor creatures, yes (<i>she</i> had
interposed the "poor creatures!") what not to do.
The burdens they took on—the things, positively,
they made an affair of! This easy and, after all,
friendly jibe at her race was really for her, on her
new friend's part, the note of personal recognition
so far as she required it; and she gave him a prompt
and conscious example of morbid anxiety by insisting
that her desire to be, herself, "lovely" all round
was justly founded on the lovely way Mrs. Lowder
had met her. He was directly interested in that,
and it was not till afterwards that she fully knew
how much more information about their friend he
had taken than given. Here again, for instance,
was a pertinent note for her: she had, on the spot,
with her first plunge into the obscure depths of a
society constituted from far back, encountered the
interesting phenomenon of complicated, of possibly
sinister motive. However, Maud Manningham
(her name, even in her presence, somehow still fed
the fancy) <i>had,</i> all the same, been lovely, and one
was going to meet her now quite as far on as one
had one's self been met. She had been with them
at their hotel—they were a pair—before even they
had supposed she could have got their letter. Of
course indeed they had written in advance, but they
had followed that up very fast. She had thus engaged
them to dine but two days later, and on the
morrow again, without waiting for a return visit,
waiting for anything, she had called with her niece.
It was as if she really cared for them, and it was
magnificent fidelity—fidelity to Mrs. Stringham,
her own companion and Mrs. Lowder's former
schoolmate, the lady with the charming face and the
rather high dress down there at the end.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>However, they'd address those points later. The details of the situation that were immediately clear, despite his tendency to be vague when it suited him, were quite specific. He remarked to her that she was already preoccupied with what she should say to the people on the other side of her—a typical American trait, he noted. In truth, she didn't *need* to say anything, but Americans never understood that, nor, unfortunately, did they know what *not* to do (she had interjected "poor things!"). The things they worried about—the things they deliberately made complicated! This good-natured, and ultimately friendly, teasing of her nationality was, for her new friend, a sign of personal connection and acknowledgment, at least as far as she needed it. She promptly and consciously displayed her own tendency toward overthinking by claiming that her desire to be universally "charming" was justified by the welcoming way Mrs. Lowder had greeted her. He was immediately intrigued by that, and it wasn’t until later that she realized how much more information about their friend he had gleaned than he had offered. For example, here was another relevant point for her: upon her initial foray into the murky world of a long-established social circle, she’d encountered the fascinating phenomenon of hidden, possibly suspicious, motives. Still, Maud Manningham (her name, even as she said it, somehow still sparked the imagination) had been lovely, and she was now going to meet her with a similar degree of openness. Maud had been at their hotel with them—they were a pair—before they even expected her to have received their letter. Of course, they had written in advance, but she had followed up very quickly. She had invited them to dinner just two days later, and the very next day, without waiting for them to reciprocate or anything else, she’d called with her niece. It was as if she genuinely cared about them, and it was a magnificent display of loyalty—loyalty to Mrs. Stringham, her own companion and Mrs. Lowder's former school friend, the woman with the charming face and the rather formal dress standing over there at the end.</i></p></div>

It was strange his words should have given her
the sense of his knowing, but it was positive that
they did so, and to the extent of making her believe
them, though still with wonder. That, really, from
this first of their meetings, was what was most to
abide with her: she accepted almost helplessly, she
surrendered to the inevitability of being the sort of
thing, as he might have said, that he at least thoroughly
believed he had, in going about, seen here
enough of for all practical purposes. Her submission
was naturally, moreover, not to be impaired by
her learning later on that he had paid at short intervals,
though at a time apparently just previous to
her own emergence from the obscurity of extreme
youth, three separate visits to New York, where his
nameable friends and his contrasted contacts had
been numerous. His impression, his recollection of
the whole mixed quantity, was still visibly rich. It
had helped him to place her, and she was more and
more sharply conscious of having—as with the door
sharply slammed upon her and the guard's hand
raised in signal to the train—been popped into the
compartment in which she was to travel for him.
It was a use of her that many a girl would have been
doubtless quick to resent; and the kind of mind that
thus, in our young lady, made all for mere seeing and
taking is precisely one of the charms of our subject.
Milly had practically just learned from him, had
made out, as it were, from her rumbling compartment,
that he gave her the highest place among their
friend's actual properties. She was a success, that
was what it came to, he presently assured her, and
that was what it was to be a success: it always happened
before one could know it. One's ignorance
was in fact often the greatest part of it. "You
haven't had time yet," he said; "this is nothing.
But you'll see. You'll see everything. You can,
you know—everything you dream of."

His impression, his memory of this whole varied group, was still clearly vivid. It had helped him figure her out, and she was increasingly aware of being—like a door slammed shut on her and the guard signaling the train—thrust into the situation in which she was going to be involved with him.

He made her more and more wonder; she almost
felt as if he were showing her visions while he spoke;
and strangely enough, though it was visions that had
drawn her on, she hadn't seen them in connection—that
is in such preliminary and necessary connection—with
such a face as Lord Mark's, such eyes and
such a voice, such a tone and such a manner. He
had for an instant the effect of making her ask herself
if she were after all going to be afraid; so distinct
was it for fifty seconds that a fear passed over
her. There they were again—yes, certainly: Susie's
overture to Mrs. Lowder had been their joke, but
they had pressed in that gaiety an electric bell that
continued to sound. Positively, while she sat there,
she had the loud rattle in her ears, and she wondered,
during these moments, why the others didn't hear it.
They didn't stare, they didn't smile, and the fear in
her that I speak of was but her own desire to stop it.
That dropped, however, as if the alarm itself had
ceased; she seemed to have seen in a quick, though
tempered glare that there were two courses for her,
one to leave London again the first thing in the morning,
the other to do nothing at all. Well, she would
do nothing at all; she was already doing it; more
than that, she had already done it, and her chance
was gone. She gave herself up—she had the
strangest sense, on the spot, of so deciding; for she
had turned a corner before she went on again with
Lord Mark. Inexpressive, but intensely significant,
he met as no one else could have done the very question
she had suddenly put to Mrs. Stringham on the
Brünig. Should she have it, whatever she did have,
that question had been, for long? "Ah, so possibly
not," her neighbour appeared to reply; "therefore,
don't you see? <i>I'm</i> the way." It was vivid that he
might be, in spite of his absence of flourish; the way
being doubtless just <i>in</i> that absence. The handsome
girl, whom she didn't lose sight of and who, she felt,
kept her also in view—Mrs. Lowder's striking niece
would, perhaps, be the way as well, for in her too
was the absence of flourish, though she had little else,
so far as one could tell, in common with Lord Mark.
Yet how indeed <i>could</i> one tell, what did one understand,
and of what was one, for that matter, provisionally
conscious but of their being somehow together
in what they represented? Kate Croy, fine
but friendly, looked over at her as really with a guess
at Lord Mark's effect on her. If she could guess
this effect what then did she know about it and in
what degree had she felt it herself? Did that represent,
as between them, anything particular, and
should she have to count with them as duplicating,
as intensifying by a mutual intelligence, the relation
into which she was sinking? Nothing was so odd
as that she should have to recognise so quickly in
each of these glimpses of an instant the various signs
of a relation; and this anomaly itself, had she had
more time to give to it, might well, might almost terribly
have suggested to her that her doom was to live
fast. It was queerly a question of the short run and
the consciousness proportionately crowded.

Strangely enough, even though visions had drawn her in, she hadn't seen them connected—specifically, in such a crucial and necessary way—with a face like Lord Mark's, or with his eyes, voice, tone, and manner. For a moment, he made her wonder if she was going to be afraid; so distinct was the feeling, even if only for a short time, that fear washed over her. There they were again – yes, definitely: Susie's introduction to Mrs. Lowder had been their inside joke, but in that moment of levity, they had triggered an alarm bell that continued to ring. Honestly, as she sat there, she heard the loud ringing in her ears, and she wondered why the others didn’t hear it. They didn't stare, they didn't smile, and the fear I'm describing was only her own desire to make it stop. That fear, however, vanished, as if the alarm itself had ceased. She seemed to have realized in a flash of understanding that she had two options: leave London first thing in the morning, or do absolutely nothing. Well, she would do nothing; she was already doing it. More than that, she had already done it, and her opportunity was gone. She gave up – she had the strange feeling that she'd made that decision in that moment, because she'd changed her mind before she continued talking with Lord Mark. His expression was blank, but his impact was intense; he understood the very question she'd suddenly asked Mrs. Stringham on the Brünig. Should she have it, whatever she had – that had been the question for a long time. "Ah, maybe not," her neighbor seemed to reply. "Therefore, don't you see? I'm the way." It was clear that he might be, even without trying to be; the way, undoubtedly, was in that lack of effort. The beautiful girl whom she didn't take her eyes off of, and who, she felt, was also watching her—Mrs. Lowder's striking niece—might also be the way, because she too lacked effort, though, as far as one could tell, she had little else in common with Lord Mark. Yet, how could one know? What did one understand? What was she, for that matter, tentatively aware of, except for the fact that they were somehow connected in what they represented? Kate Croy, elegant but approachable, looked over at her as though she could guess the effect Lord Mark had on her. If she could guess that effect, then what did she know about it, and to what extent had she felt it herself? Did that represent anything specific between them, and should she have to consider them as duplicating and intensifying their shared understanding of the situation she was getting involved in? It was so odd that she had to recognize so quickly the various signs of their connection in each of these brief moments. This very strangeness, if she'd had more time to think about it, might have suggested to her—almost frighteningly—that her fate was to live life quickly. It was a strange question of the short term and a correspondingly compressed consciousness.</i></p></div>

These were immense excursions for the spirit of
a young person at Mrs. Lowder's mere dinner-party;
but what was so significant and so admonitory as the
fact of their being possible? What could they have
been but just a part, already, of the crowded consciousness?
And it was just a part, likewise, that
while plates were changed and dishes presented and
periods in the banquet marked; while appearances
insisted and phenomena multiplied and words
reached her from here and there like plashes of a
slow, thick tide; while Mrs. Lowder grew somehow
more stout and more instituted and Susie, at her
distance and in comparison, more thinly improvised
and more different—different, that is, from every
one and everything: it was just a part that while
this process went forward our young lady alighted,
came back, taking up her destiny again as if she had
been able by a wave or two of her wings to place
herself briefly in sight of an alternative to it. Whatever
it was it had showed in this brief interval as
better than the alternative; and it now presented itself
altogether in the image and in the place in which
she had left it. The image was that of her being,
as Lord Mark had declared, a success. This depended
more or less of course on his idea of the thing—into
which at present, however, she wouldn't go.
But, renewing soon, she had asked him what he
meant then that Mrs. Lowder would do with her,
and he had replied that this might safely be left.
"She'll get back," he pleasantly said, "her money."
He could say it too—which was singular—without
affecting her either as vulgar or as "nasty "; and
he had soon explained himself by adding: "Nobody
here, you know, does anything for nothing."

Whatever that alternative was, it had, for a brief moment, seemed better than her current reality. And now, it presented itself in the same form and place she had left it.

She neglected his question for a little, partly because
her attention attached itself more and more to
the handsome girl, partly because, placed so near
their hostess, she wished not to show as discussing
her too freely. Mrs. Lowder, it was true, steering
in the other quarter a course in which she called at
subjects as if they were islets in an archipelago, continued
to allow them their ease, and Kate Croy, at
the same time, steadily revealed herself as interesting.
Milly in fact found, of a sudden, her ease—found
it all—as she bethought herself that what Mrs.
Lowder was really arranging for was a report on
her quality and, as perhaps might be said, her value
from Lord Mark. She wished him, the wonderful
lady, to have no pretext for not knowing what he
thought of Miss Theale. Why his judgment so
mattered remained to be seen; but it was this divination,
in any case, that now determined Milly's rejoinder.
"No. She knows you. She has probably
reason to. And you all, here, know each other—I
see that—so far as you know anything. You
know what you're used to, and it's your being used
to it—that, and that only—that makes you. But
there are things you don't know."

Meanwhile, Kate Croy was steadily proving to be a compelling person. Milly suddenly felt comfortable, realizing that Mrs. Lowder was really trying to gather information about her character and, maybe, her worth, for Lord Mark. She wanted the wonderful Mrs. Lowder to have no excuse for not knowing what he thought of Miss Theale. Why his opinion was so important was still unclear, but this realization determined Milly's response. "No. She knows you. She probably has a reason to.

Lord Mark, at this, threw back his head, ranging
with his eyes the opposite side of the room and
showing himself at last so much more completely
as diverted that it fairly attracted their hostess's notice.
Mrs. Lowder, however, only smiled on Milly

If it established thus that they couldn't, or
Wouldn't, mix, why, none the less, did Milly feel,
through it, a perverse quickening of the relation to
which she had been, in spite of herself, appointed?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>If it was proven they couldn't or wouldn't get along, why did Milly still feel, despite it all, a strange excitement about the relationship she was involved in, even though she hadn't chosen it?</i></p></div>

What queerer consequence of their not mixing than
their talking—for it was what they had arrived at—almost
intimately? She wished to get away from
him, or indeed, much rather, away from herself so
far as she was present to him. She saw already—wonderful
creature, after all, herself too—that there
would be a good deal more of him to come for her,
and that the special sign of their intercourse would
be to keep herself out of the question. Everything
else might come in—only never that; and with such
an arrangement they might even go far. This in
fact might quite have begun, on the spot, with her
returning again to the topic of the handsome girl.
If she was to keep herself out she could naturally best
do so by putting in somebody else. She accordingly
put in Kate Croy, being ready to that extent—as she
was not at all afraid for her—to sacrifice her if necessary.
Lord Mark himself, for that matter, had
made it easy by saying a little while before that no
one among them did anything for nothing. "What
then"—she was aware of being abrupt—"does
Miss Croy, if she's so interested, do it for? What
has she to gain by <i>her</i> lovely welcome? Look at
her <i>now!"</i> Milly broke out with characteristic
freedom of praise, though pulling herself up also
with a compunctious "Oh!" as the direction thus
given to their eyes happened to coincide with a turn
of Kate's face to them. All she had meant to do
was to insist that this face was fine; but what she
had in fact done was to renew again her effect of
showing herself to its possessor as conjoined with
Lord Mark for some interested view of it. He had,
however, promptly met her question.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Isn't it odd that the only result of them *not* being close was that they were actually talking – and almost like they were best friends? She wanted to escape him, or rather, to escape the feeling of herself that she was presenting to him.

"So then," she said abruptly, "what does Miss Croy, if she's so interested, get out of it? What's her reason for being so welcoming? Look at her now!" Milly gushed with her usual enthusiasm, though she also stopped herself with a quick "Oh!" because the direction of their gaze happened to coincide with Kate turning her head towards them. All she'd meant to do was to emphasize that Kate's face was beautiful, but what she'd actually done was reinforce the impression that she and Lord Mark were somehow connected and looking at Kate with some ulterior motive.

"No—I've failed with her. It's no use. I don't
make her out. And I assure you I really should like
to." His assurance had in fact for his companion a
positive suggestion of sincerity; he affected her as
now saying something that he felt; and she was the
more struck with it as she was still conscious of the
failure even of curiosity he had just shown in respect
to herself. She had meant something—though indeed
for herself almost only—in speaking of their
friend's natural pity; it had been a note, doubtless, of
questionable taste, but it had quavered out in spite of
her; and he had not so much as cared to inquire
"Why 'natural'?" Not that it wasn't really much
better for her that he shouldn't: explanations would
in truth have taken her much too far. Only she now
perceived that, in comparison, her word about this
other person really "drew" him; and there were
things in that, probably, many things, as to which
she would learn more and which glimmered there
already as part and parcel of that larger "real" with
which, in her new situation, she was to be beguiled.
It was in fact at the very moment, this element, not
absent from what Lord Mark was further saying.
"So you're wrong, you see, as to our knowing all
about each other. There are cases where we break
down. I at any rate give <i>her</i> up—up, that is, to you.
You must do her for me—tell me, I mean, when you
know more. You'll notice," he pleasantly wound
up, "that I've confidence in you."

His sincerity was actually quite convincing to her companion; he seemed to be saying something genuine, and she was more affected by it because she was still aware of the lack of even curiosity he had just shown about her. She had intended something—though mostly for herself—when she mentioned their friend's natural compassion; it was probably a bit tactless, but it had slipped out anyway, and he hadn't even bothered to ask "Why 'natural'?" Not that it was necessarily bad for her that he didn't: explaining would have been too complicated. But she realized that her comment about this other person actually interested him; and there were things in that, probably many things, that she'd learn more about, and which were already hinting at the bigger "reality" that was supposed to consume her in her new situation. In fact, that very element was present even as Lord Mark continued speaking.</i></p><p><i>"So you're mistaken, you see, about us knowing everything about each other.

"Why shouldn't you have?" Milly asked, observing
in this, as she thought, a fine, though, for such
a man, a surprisingly artless, fatuity. It was as if
there might have been a question of her falsifying
for the sake of her own show—that is of her honesty
not being proof against her desire to keep well with
him herself. She didn't, none the less, otherwise
protest against his remark; there was something else
she was occupied in seeing. It was the handsome
girl alone, one of his own species and his own society,
who had made him feel uncertain; of his certainties
about a mere little American, a cheap exotic, imported
almost wholesale, and whose habitat, with its
conditions of climate, growth, and cultivation, its
immense profusion, but its few varieties and thin
development, he was perfectly satisfied. The marvel
was, too, that Milly understood his satisfaction—feeling
that she expressed the truth in presently
saying: "Of course; I make out that she must be
difficult; just as I see that I myself must be easy."
And that was what, for all the rest of this occasion,
remained with her—as the most interesting thing
that could remain. She was more and more content
herself to be easy; she would have been resigned,
even had it been brought straighter home to her, to
passing for a cheap exotic. Provisionally, at any
rate, that protected her wish to keep herself, with
Lord Mark, in abeyance. They <i>had</i> all affected her
as inevitably knowing each other, and if the handsome
girl's place among them was something even
their initiation couldn't deal with—why, then, she
would indeed be a quantity.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Why wouldn't you?" Milly asked, noticing what she considered a naive, almost shockingly simple, self-deception in him, especially for someone like him. It was as if he suspected she might be pretending, just to make a good impression – that her honesty might not be strong enough to overcome her desire to stay on his good side. But she didn't object to his comment; she was focused on something else. She was looking at the beautiful woman, one of his own kind and from his social circle, who had made him feel insecure. He had been so sure about a little American like her—a cheap, foreign import, almost mass-produced, whose background, with its specific environment, upbringing, and limited development, he fully understood. The surprising thing was that Milly understood his satisfaction, and she expressed the truth when she said, "Of course. I can see she must be challenging, just as I can see I must be easygoing." And that statement stayed with her for the rest of their conversation, as the most interesting thing to come from it. She was increasingly happy to be easygoing. She would have accepted, even if it had been made clearer, being seen as a cheap exotic. For the time being, at least, that allowed her to postpone any further involvement with Lord Mark. They all seemed to know each other intimately, and if the beautiful woman's place among them was something they couldn't even explain—well, then, she would be a valuable and significant person.</i></p></div>
