<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>During a drive in Battersea Park, Susan (Susie) Shepherd learns from Mrs. Lowder that Mrs. Lowder and her niece, Kate Croy, are acquainted with Milly's friend, Mr. Merton Densher. Later, Susie tells Milly this news. Milly acts surprised. Susie explains that Mrs. Lowder mentioned a young journalist who had gone to America, and Susie confirmed it was Mr. Densher, an acquaintance of Milly's.</p><p>Milly tells Susie that she did the right thing in revealing the connection. Susie then relays a message from Mrs. Lowder: Milly should not mention Mr. Densher to Kate unless Kate brings him up first. Milly asks if there is something between Kate and Mr. Densher. Susie says she thinks not, but Mrs. Lowder is being cautious. Susie adds that Mrs. Lowder wants her niece to marry Lord Mark.</p><p>For the next few days, Milly observes Kate, knowing that Kate also knows Mr. Densher, but says nothing to her about it.</p><p>Milly and Kate visit Kate’s sister, Mrs. Condrip. Later that evening, Milly tells Susie what happened during the visit. While Kate was out of the room, Mrs. Condrip told Milly that Mr. Densher is in love with Kate, which she considers a dreadful situation because of his poverty. Mrs. Condrip asked Milly to help do something about it and also asked Milly not to tell Kate about their conversation. Milly did not tell Mrs. Condrip that she herself knew Mr. Densher.</p><p>Milly tells Susie that according to Mrs. Condrip, Mrs. Lowder disapproves of Mr. Densher. Susie corrects this, saying Mrs. Lowder actually likes him and thinks he is very able. Milly and Susie discuss the situation. Milly believes that if Mrs. Condrip knew that Milly also knew Densher, she would tell Kate in order to make Kate jealous and turn her against him. Milly concludes the conversation by clarifying that Mrs. Condrip only said that Densher was in love with Kate, not that Kate was in love with him. She says that if Kate were in love, Mrs. Condrip would have said so.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Milly is presented as a character with a stark public/private divide. In public, she can be "detached as the occasion required," but in private, she is deeply intimate and open with her confidante, Susan Shepherd. She is wealthy, observant, and possesses a "strange gaiety" coupled with a fascination for social complexity, stating, "I want abysses." She also displays a morbid, fatalistic humor regarding a fragile health condition.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically with the news that her new friend, Kate Croy, and her circle already know her recent acquaintance, Merton Densher. This revelation "altered all proportions" for her, turning an amusing coincidence into a "new sort of fun" containing "a small element of anxiety." She immediately becomes a participant in a social intrigue, agreeing to keep her knowledge of Densher a secret from Kate.</li>
<li>*Susan Shepherd (Susie/Mrs. Stringham)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is Milly's loyal, devoted, and sometimes "venerably simple" companion. She serves as Milly's primary confidante and feels a protective, almost maternal duty towards her ("I'd die for you"). She is presented as a somewhat flustered navigator of the complex English social world she has been "rapt" into.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts from passive companion to active agent in the plot. By relaying the news about Densher from Mrs. Lowder, and later receiving an unsolicited confession from Mrs. Condrip, she becomes the keeper of multiple secrets and a key conduit of information between the other characters.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Kate is presented almost entirely through Milly's changing perception. Initially, she is a "handsome" new friend with whom Milly shares a "deep" and "sudden" intimacy. She is also positioned as being under the social control of her aunt, "involved in her aunt's designs."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** With the revelation of her connection to Densher, she is immediately recast in Milly's mind as a person with a hidden, "not wholly calculable" side. Her silence on the subject of Densher transforms her from a transparent friend into an enigma, surrounded by a "great darkness."</li>
<li>*Merton Densher**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** He is an off-stage character whose identity is built through the conflicting reports of others. He is a "young journalist" who is described by Mrs. Condrip as poor and lacking prospects, but by Mrs. Lowder as "exceptionally able."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** He is abruptly transformed from a minor New York acquaintance of Milly's into the central figure of a complex social secret linking all the main characters. His prior silence about his English friends is suddenly rendered significant.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is a formidable and manipulative social strategist. She is wealthy, powerful, and intent on controlling her niece's future, specifically by arranging a marriage to Lord Mark. She is presented as shrewdly precautionary, immediately moving to control the flow of information about Densher.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** The unexpected appearance of Milly, who also knows Densher, introduces an unknown variable into her carefully managed plans for Kate, prompting her immediate directive for silence.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Condrip (Marian)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Kate's sister, she lives in a lower social sphere ("in quite another geography"). She is portrayed as worried, perhaps meddlesome, and unimpressed by her sister's world.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** She acts as an unplanned catalyst. By impulsively revealing to Milly that Densher is in love with Kate and that she considers the match "dreadful," she confirms the romantic nature of the secret and escalates the intrigue.</li></ul>

<p>
She certainly made up with Susie directly, however,
for any allowance she might have had privately to
extend to tepid appreciation; since the late and long
talks of these two embraced not only everything
offered and suggested by the hours they spent apart,
but a good deal more besides. She might be as detached
as the occasion required at four o'clock in the
afternoon, but she used no such freedom to any one
about anything as she habitually used about everything
to Susan Shepherd at midnight. All the same,
it should with much less delay than this have been
mentioned, she had not yet—had not, that is, at the
end of six days—produced any news for her comrade
to compare with an announcement made her by the
latter as a result of a drive with Mrs. Lowder, for a
change, in the remarkable Battersea Park. The
elder friends had sociably revolved there while the
younger ones followed bolder fancies in the admirable
equipage appointed to Milly at the hotel—a
heavier, more emblazoned, more amusing chariot
than she had ever, with "stables" notoriously mismanaged,
known at home; whereby, in the course
of the circuit, more than once repeated, it had "come
out," as Mrs. Stringham said, that the couple at Lancaster
Gate were, of all people, acquainted with Mildred's
other English friend—the gentleman, the one
connected with the English newspaper (Susie hung
fire a little over his name) who had been with her
in New York so shortly previous to present adventures.
He had been named of course in Battersea
Park—else he couldn't have been identified; and
Susie had naturally, before she could produce her
own share in the matter as a kind of confession, to
make it plain that her allusion was to Mr. Merton
Densher. This was because Milly had at first a little
air of not knowing whom she meant; and the girl
really kept, as well, a certain control of herself while
she remarked that the case was surprising, the chance
one in a thousand. They knew him, both Maud
and Miss Croy knew him, she gathered too, rather
well, though indeed it was not on any show of intimacy
that he had happened to be mentioned. It had
not been—Susie made the point—she herself who
brought him in: he had in fact not been brought in
at all, but only referred to as a young journalist
known to Mrs. Lowder and who had lately gone to
their wonderful country—Mrs. Lowder always said
"your wonderful country"—on behalf of his journal.
But Mrs. Stringham had taken it up—with the tips
of her fingers indeed; and that was the confession:
she had, without meaning any harm, recognised Mr.
Densher as an acquaintance of Milly's, though she
had also pulled herself up before getting in too far.
Mrs. Lowder had been struck, clearly—it wasn't too
much to say; then she also, it had rather seemed, had
pulled herself up; and there had been a little moment
during which each might have been keeping something
from the other. "Only," said Milly's mate,
"I luckily remembered in time that I had nothing
whatever to keep—which was much simpler and
nicer. I don't know what Maud has, but there it
is. She was interested, distinctly, in your knowing
him—in his having met you over there with so little
loss of time. But I ventured to tell her it hadn't
been so long as to make you as yet great friends.
I don't know if I was right."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She immediately made up with Susie, though, for any slight reservations she might have had. Their late-night conversations covered everything that had happened and been discussed while they were apart, and even more. She could be as reserved as the situation required in the afternoon, but she was never so guarded with anyone as she was with Susie at midnight. However, she should have mentioned this sooner. She hadn't yet, after six days, given Susie any news to match Susie’s, which she’d gotten after a drive with Mrs. Lowder, a change of pace, in Battersea Park. The older women had socialized there while the younger women indulged bolder fantasies in Milly’s wonderful carriage from the hotel—a more elaborate and impressive one than she’d ever had at home, where things were in disarray. During their drive around the park, it had come out, as Mrs. Stringham said, that the people at Lancaster Gate knew, of all people, Mildred’s other English friend—the man who worked for the English newspaper (Susie paused for his name) and had been with her in New York recently. He’d been mentioned in Battersea Park, of course, or they wouldn’t have realized who they were talking about. Susie, before sharing her own news as a confession, had to clarify that she was talking about Mr. Merton Densher. Milly had seemed at first not to know who she meant, and she kept herself under control while saying the situation was surprising, a one-in-a-thousand chance. Maud and Miss Croy knew him too, Susie understood, rather well, although their acquaintance hadn't been mentioned in a very intimate way. Susie pointed out that she hadn't brought him up; he hadn't actually been brought up, but only referred to as a young journalist known to Mrs. Lowder, who had recently gone to "your wonderful country" (as Mrs. Lowder always said) for his newspaper. Mrs. Stringham had taken it up with barely a touch, and that was the confession: she’d, without meaning any harm, recognized Mr. Densher as an acquaintance of Milly's, although she’d also stopped herself before going too far. Mrs. Lowder was clearly impressed, it was no exaggeration to say; then, she too had seemed to stop herself. There was a moment when each of them might have been hiding something. "But," said Milly's friend, "I was lucky enough to remember in time that I had nothing to hide, which was much simpler and nicer. I don't know what Maud has, but there it is. She was definitely interested that you knew him—that he'd met you so quickly over there. But I told her it hadn’t been long enough for you to be great friends yet. I don't know if I was right."</i></p></div>

<p>
Whatever time this explanation might have taken,
there had been moments enough in the matter now—before
the elder woman's conscience had done itself
justice—to enable Milly to reply that although the
fact in question doubtless had its importance she
imagined they wouldn't find the importance overwhelming.
It <i>was</i> odd that their one Englishman
should so instantly fit; it wasn't, however, miraculous—they
surely all had often seen that, as every
one said, the world was extraordinarily "small."
Undoubtedly, too, Susie had done just the plain
thing in not letting his name pass. Why in the
world should there be a mystery?—and what an immense
one they would appear to have made if he
should come back and find they had concealed their
knowledge of him! "I don't know, Susie dear,"
the girl observed, "what you think I have to conceal."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>No matter how long this conversation took, enough time had passed – before the older woman resolved her own internal conflict – for Milly to respond. She said that while the issue was probably significant, she didn't think it was that big a deal. It was strange that their only Englishman fit in so easily, but not unbelievable – as everyone always said, the world was incredibly "small." Susie had absolutely done the right thing by not mentioning his name. Why make it a mystery? And they'd look ridiculous if he returned and discovered they'd been keeping something from him!

Her friend looked at her—it was not unfrequently
the case—a little harder than the surface of the occasion
seemed to require; and another person present
at such times might have wondered to what inner
thought of her own the good lady was trying to fit
the speech. It was too much her disposition, no
doubt, to treat her young companion's words as
symptoms of an imputed malady. It was none the
less, however, her highest law to be light when the
girl was light. She knew how to be quaint with
the new quaintness—the great Boston gift; it
had been, happily, her note in the magazines; and
Maud Lowder, to whom it was new indeed and who
had never heard anything remotely like it, quite cherished
her, as a social resource, for it. It should not
therefore fail her now; with it in fact one might
face most things. "Ah, then let us hope we shall
sound the depths—I'm prepared for the worst—of
sorrow and sin! But she would like her niece—we're
not ignorant of that, are we?—to marry Lord
Mark. Hasn't she told you so?"

She knew how to be playfully eccentric, that particular Boston talent; she had used it successfully in her magazine writing. Maud Lowder, who was unfamiliar with that kind of humor and had never heard anything like it, really valued her as a fun companion. So, she wouldn't fail her now; in fact, she could get through almost anything with that skill. "Well, let's hope we uncover the deepest, darkest secrets—I'm ready for anything—of sadness and wrongdoing! But she *wants* her niece—we all know that, right?—to marry Lord Mark.

Milly had, under her comrade's eyes, a minute of
mute detachment. She had lived with Kate Croy
for several days in a state of intimacy as deep as it
had been sudden, and they had clearly, in talk, in
many directions, proceeded to various extremities.
Yet it now came over her as in a clear cold way that
there was a possible account of their relations in
which the quantity her new friend had told her might
have figured as small, as smallest, beside the quantity
she hadn't. She couldn't say, at any rate, whether
or no she had made the point that her aunt designed
her for Lord Mark: it had only sufficiently come
out—which had been, moreover, eminently guessable—that
she was involved in her aunt's designs.
Somehow, for Milly, brush it over nervously as she
might and with whatever simplifying hand, this
abrupt extrusion of Mr. Densher altered all proportions,
had an effect on all values. It was fantastic
of her to let it make a difference that she couldn't
in the least have defined—and she was at least, even
during these instants, rather proud of being able to
hide, on the spot, the difference it did make. Yet,
all the same, the effect for her was, almost violently,
of Mr. Densher's having been there—having been
where she had stood till now in her simplicity—before
her. It would have taken but another free moment
to make her see abysses—since abysses were
what she wanted—in the mere circumstance of his
own silence, in New York, about his English friends.
There had really been in New York little time for
anything; but, had she liked, Milly could have made
it out for herself that he had avoided the subject of
Miss Croy, and that Miss Croy was yet a subject it
could never be natural to avoid. It was to be added
at the same time that even if his silence had been
labyrinthe—which was absurd in view of all the
other things too he couldn't possibly have spoken of—this
was exactly what must suit her, since it fell
under the head of the plea she had just uttered to
Susie. These things, however, came and went, and
it set itself up between the companions, for the occasion,
in the oddest way, both that their happening all
to know Mr. Densher—except indeed that Susie
didn't, but probably would,—was a fact belonging,
in a world of rushing about, to one of the common
orders of chance; and yet further that it was amusing—oh,
awfully amusing!—to be able fondly to
hope that there was "something in" its having been
left to crop up with such suddenness. There seemed
somehow a possibility that the ground or, as it were,
the air might, in a manner, have undergone some
pleasing preparation; though the question of this
possibility would probably, after all, have taken some
threshing out. The truth, moreover—and there
they were, already, our pair, talking about it, the
"truth!"—had not in fact quite cropped out. This,
obviously, in view of Mrs. Lowder's request to her
old friend.

It was accordingly on Mrs. Lowder's recommendation
that nothing should be said to Kate—it was
on this rich attitude of Aunt Maud's that the idea
of an interesting complication might best hope to
perch; and when, in fact, after the colloquy we have
reported Milly saw Kate again without mentioning
any name, her silence succeeded in passing muster
with her as the beginning of a new sort of fun. The
sort was all the newer by reason of its containing a
small element of anxiety: when she had gone in for
fun before it had been with her hands a little more
free. Yet it <i>was,</i> none the less, rather exciting to
be conscious of a still sharper reason for interest in
the handsome girl, as Kate continued, even now, pre-eminently
to remain for her; and a reason—this was
the great point—of which the young woman herself
could have no suspicion. Twice over, thus, for two
or three hours together, Milly found herself seeing
Kate, quite fixing her in the light of the knowledge
that it was a face on which Mr. Densher's eyes had
more or less familiarly rested and which, by the same
token, had looked, rather <i>more</i> beautifully than less,
into his own. She pulled herself up indeed with the
thought that it had inevitably looked, as beautifully
as one would, into thousands of faces in which one
might one's self never trace it; but just the odd result
of the thought was to intensify for the girl that
side of her friend which she had doubtless already
been more prepared than she quite knew to think of
as the "other," the not wholly calculable. It was
fantastic, and Milly was aware of this; but the
other side was what had, of a sudden, been turned
straight towards her by the show of Mr. Densher's
propinquity. She hadn't the excuse of knowing it
for Kate's own, since nothing whatever as yet proved
it particularly to be such. Never mind; it was with
this other side now fully presented that Kate came
and went, kissed her for greeting and for parting,
talked, as usual, of everything but—as it had so
abruptly become for Milly—<i>the</i> thing. Our young
woman, it is true, would doubtless not have tasted
so sharply a difference in this pair of occasions had
she not been tasting so peculiarly her own possible
betrayals. What happened was that afterwards, on
separation, she wondered if the matter had not mainly
been that she herself was so "other," so taken up
with the unspoken; the strangest thing of all being,
still subsequently, that when she asked herself how
Kate could have failed to feel it she became conscious
of being here on the edge of a great darkness. She
should never know how Kate truly felt about anything
such a one as Milly Theale should give her to
feel. Kate would never—and not from ill-will, nor
from duplicity, but from a sort of failure of common
terms—reduce it to such a one's comprehension or
put it within her convenience.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Following Mrs. Lowder's advice, nothing was to be said to Kate. This rich, confident attitude of Aunt Maud's was the best foundation for an intriguing situation to develop. And indeed, after the conversation we described, when Milly saw Kate again without mentioning anyone's name, her silence seemed to Kate like the start of a new, enjoyable game. It was a new kind of game because it had a small element of worry: when she'd had fun before, she'd been more carefree. Still, it was exciting to have a sharper reason for interest in the beautiful girl, as Kate remained for her, and a reason—this was the crucial point—that the young woman herself knew nothing about. Twice, for a few hours each time, Milly found herself observing Kate, seeing her with the clear knowledge that this was a face that Mr. Densher had looked at more or less intimately and that, by the same token, had looked, quite beautifully, into his. She stopped herself with the thought that Kate's face had inevitably looked as beautifully as anyone would into thousands of faces where she might never see it herself. But the odd thing was that this thought intensified for Milly the part of her friend that she was already prepared to think of as the "other," the unpredictable side. It was a fantasy, and Milly knew this, but the other side had suddenly been revealed by Mr. Densher's closeness. She couldn't claim it as Kate's own, since nothing yet proved it was. Never mind; it was with this other side fully present that Kate came and went, kissed her hello and goodbye, and talked, as usual, about everything but—as it had abruptly become for Milly—the crucial issue. Of course, our young woman wouldn't have felt this difference so strongly if she hadn't been so aware of her own possible betrayal. Afterwards, she wondered if the main issue was that she herself was so "other," so preoccupied with the unspoken. The strangest thing of all was that when she asked herself how Kate could have failed to sense it, she realized she was on the edge of a great mystery. She would never know how Kate truly felt about something that a person like Milly Theale would allow her to feel. Kate would never—not out of malice or deceit, but out of a lack of shared understanding—bring it down to such a person's level of comprehension or make it convenient for her.</i></p></div>

It was as such a one, therefore, that, for three or
four days more, Milly watched Kate as just such
another; and it was presently as such a one that she
threw herself into their promised visit, at last
achieved, to Chelsea, the quarter of the famous Carlyle,
the field of exercise of his ghost, his votaries,
and the residence of "poor Marian," so often referred
to and actually a somewhat incongruous spirit
there. With our young woman's first view of poor
Marian everything gave way but the sense of how,
in England, apparently, the social situation of sisters
could be opposed, how common ground, for a place
in the world, could quite fail them: a state of things
sagely perceived to be involved in an hierarchical, an
aristocratic order. Just whereabouts in the order
Mrs. Lowder had established her niece was a question
not wholly void, as yet, no doubt, of ambiguity—though
Milly was withal sure Lord Mark could
exactly have fixed the point if he would, fixing it at
the same time for Aunt Maud herself; but it was
clear that Mrs. Condrip was, as might have been said,
in quite another geography. She would not, in
short, have been to be found on the same social map,
and it was as if her visitors had turned over page
after page together before the final relief of their
benevolent "Here!" The interval was bridged,
of course, but the bridge, verily, was needed, and the
impression left Milly to wonder whether, in the general
connection, it were of bridges or of intervals
that the spirit not locally disciplined would find itself
most conscious. It was as if at home, by contrast,
there were neither—neither the difference
itself, from position to position, nor, on either side,
and particularly on one, the awfully good manner,
the conscious sinking of a consciousness, that made
up for it. The conscious sinking, at all events, and
the awfully good manner, the difference, the bridge,
the interval, the skipped leaves of the social atlas—these,
it was to be confessed, had a little, for our
young lady, in default of stouter stuff, to work themselves
into the light literary legend—a mixed, wandering
echo of Trollope, of Thackeray, perhaps
mostly of Dickens—under favour of which her pilgrimage
had so much appealed. She could relate
to Susie later on, late the same evening, that the
legend, before she had done with it, had run clear,
that the adored author of <i>The Newcomes</i>, in fine, had
been on the whole the note: the picture lacking thus
more than she had hoped, or rather perhaps showing
less than she had feared, a certain possibility of Pickwickian
outline. She explained how she meant by
this that Mrs. Condrip had not altogether proved another
Mrs. Nickleby, nor even—for she might have
proved almost anything, from the way poor worried
Kate had spoken—a widowed and aggravated Mrs.
Micawber.

Milly then enthusiastically embraced their long-awaited visit to Chelsea, the area associated with the famous writer Carlyle, a place haunted by his memory and frequented by his admirers. It was also the residence of "poor Marian," a figure often mentioned and whose presence seemed somewhat out of place. Upon seeing poor Marian, Milly was struck by the stark contrast in the social standing of sisters in England, where they often lacked common ground in the world. She saw this as a consequence of the rigid social hierarchy.</i></p><p><i>Where exactly Mrs. Lowder had placed her niece was still somewhat unclear, although Milly suspected Lord Mark could have pinpointed it perfectly if he had chosen to, and that he could have done so for Aunt Maud as well.

It was as if Milly and Kate had to flip through many pages before finally finding Mrs. Condrip.</i></p><p><i>The visit bridged the gap between them, but that bridge was essential. Milly wondered if the unsophisticated, inexperienced part of her would be more aware of the bridges or the gaps in such situations. It was as if, back home, there were neither—neither the social differences, nor the extraordinarily polite behavior and the conscious suppression of feelings that made up for those differences. The politeness, the social differences, the bridge, the gap, the missing pages of the social guide—all this, had to be admitted, had, for our young lady, filled a literary niche—an echo of Trollope, Thackeray, and especially Dickens—which had shaped her pilgrimage.</i></p><p><i>She could tell Susie later that evening that she had realized the predominant influence had been the author of *The Newcomes*.

Mrs. Stringham, in the midnight conference, intimated
rather yearningly that, however the event
might have turned, the side of English life such experiences
opened to Milly were just those she herself
seemed "booked"—as they were all, roundabout
her now, always saying—to miss: she had begun to
have a little, for her fellow-observer, these moments
of fanciful reaction—reaction in which she was once
more all Susan Shepherd—against the high sphere
of colder conventions into which her overwhelming
connection with Maud Manningham had rapt her.
Milly never lost sight, for long, of the Susan Shepherd
side of her, and was always there to meet it
when it came up and vaguely, tenderly, impatiently
to pat it, abounding in the assurance that they would
still provide for it. They had, however, to-night,
another matter in hand; which proved to be presently,
on the girl's part, in respect to her hour of
Chelsea, the revelation that Mrs. Condrip, taking a
few minutes when Kate was away with one of the
children, in bed upstairs for some small complaint,
had suddenly, without its being in the least "led up
to," broken ground on the subject of Mr. Densher,
mentioned him with impatience as a person in love
with her sister. "She wished me, if I cared for
Kate, to know," Milly said—"for it would be quite
too dreadful, and one might do something."

Mrs. Stringham seemed to be "booked" to miss these experiences, as everyone around her was always saying. Mrs. Stringham had begun to feel these moments of emotional response—a return to her more ordinary self—as a fellow observer of Milly. This response was a reaction against the formal and emotionally distant world she had been drawn into through her close friendship with Maud Manningham.</i></p><p><i>Milly never forgot her ordinary self and was always ready to connect with it when it surfaced. She would gently, almost impatiently, comfort it, reassuring herself that they would still make time for it. However, tonight, they had another issue to address. This issue, revealed by Milly concerning her time in Chelsea, was that Mrs. Condrip, taking a break when Kate was away with one of the children who was in bed upstairs with a minor illness, had suddenly, and without any prompting, brought up the subject of Mr. Densher. Mrs. Condrip mentioned him irritably, claiming he was in love with her sister.

The girl had by this time clearly made it out.
"Nothing but to admire and make much of her sister—whom
she doesn't, however, herself in the least
understand—and give up one's time, and everything
else, to it." It struck the elder friend that she spoke
with an almost unprecedented approach to sharpness;
as if Mrs. Condrip had been rather specially
disconcerting. Never yet so much as just of late
had Mrs. Stringham seen her companion as exalted,
and by the very play of something within, into a
vague golden air that left irritation below. That
was the great thing with Milly—it was her characteristic
poetry; or at least it was Susan Shepherd's.

Milly had, she thought, an hesitation—something

"Then there it is!" On which, with a drop and
one of those sudden, slightly sighing surrenders to
a vague reflux and a general fatigue that had recently
more than once marked themselves for her companion,
Milly turned away. Yet the matter was not
left so, that night, between them, albeit neither perhaps
could afterwards have said which had first
come back to it. Milly's own nearest approach, at
least, for a little, to doing so, was to remark that they
appeared all—every one they saw—to think tremendously
of money. This prompted in Susie a laugh,
not untender, the innocent meaning of which was
that it came, as a subject for indifference, money
did, easier to some people than to others: she made
the point in fairness, however, that you couldn't have
told, by any too crude transparency of air, what
place it held for Maud Manningham. She did
her worldliness with grand proper silences—if it
mightn't better be put perhaps that she did her detachment
with grand occasional pushes. However
Susie put it, in truth, she was really, in justice to herself,
thinking of the difference, as favourites of fortune,
between her old friend and her new. Aunt
Maud sat somehow in the midst of her money,
founded on it and surrounded by it, even if with a
clever high manner about it, her manner of looking,
hard and bright, as if it weren't there. Milly, about
hers, had no manner at all—which was possibly,
from a point of view, a fault: she was at any rate
far away on the edge of it, and you hadn't, as might
be said, in order to get at her nature, to traverse, by
whatever avenue, any piece of her property. It was
clear, on the other hand, that Mrs. Lowder was keeping
her wealth as for purposes, imaginations, ambitions,
that would figure as large, as honourably unselfish,
on the day they should take effect. She
would impose her will, but her will would be only
that a person or two shouldn't lose a benefit by not
submitting if they could be made to submit. To
Milly, as so much younger, such far views couldn't
be imputed: there was nobody she was supposable
as interested for. It was too soon, since she wasn't
interested for herself. Even the richest woman, at
her age, lacked motive, and Milly's motive doubtless
had plenty of time to arrive. She was meanwhile
beautiful, simple, sublime without it—whether missing
it and vaguely reaching out for it or not; and
with it, for that matter, in the event, would really be
these things just as much. Only then she might
very well have, like Aunt Maud, a manner. Such
were the connections, at all events, in which the colloquy
of our two ladies freshly flickered up—in which
it came round that the elder asked the younger if she
had herself, in the afternoon, named Mr. Densher
as an acquaintance.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Well, that's that," Milly said with a sigh, her body relaxing into a weary surrender, something her companion had noticed more and more lately. Then she turned away. But that night, the subject came up again between them, though neither could later recall who brought it up first. Milly's initial observation was that everyone they knew seemed obsessed with money. Susie laughed gently, suggesting some people find money easier to ignore than others. She pointed out that it was impossible to tell what money meant to Maud Manningham. Maud carried herself with a sophisticated, distant air, though perhaps it was more accurate to say she acted detached with occasional displays of force. Regardless of how Susie phrased it, she was really thinking about the contrast between her old friend and her new one, both beneficiaries of good fortune. Aunt Maud seemed to sit at the center of her wealth, built upon it and surrounded by it, even if she adopted a clever, aloof demeanor, as if the money wasn't even there. Milly, on the other hand, had no such facade, which might be a flaw. She was far removed from her wealth, and you didn't have to navigate any of her possessions to understand her character. Mrs. Lowder, however, clearly intended to use her wealth to pursue goals, ambitions, and plans that would seem grand and selfless when they came to fruition. She would impose her will, but only to ensure that someone wouldn't miss an opportunity if they could be persuaded to cooperate. Milly, being much younger, couldn't be accused of such long-term planning, as she had no one to look out for. She wasn't even looking out for herself yet. Even the wealthiest woman at her age lacked that drive, and Milly certainly had time to develop it. For now, she was beautiful, simple, and naturally admirable, regardless of whether she desired money or not; in the end, it wouldn't change any of those things. Only then, she might develop a manner like Aunt Maud. That's how the conversation between the two women rekindled, leading the older woman to ask the younger if she had mentioned Mr. Densher as an acquaintance that afternoon.</i></p></div>

It dispelled, on the spot—something, to the elder
woman's ear, in the sad, sweet sound of it—any
ghost of any need of explaining. The sense was
constant for her that their relation was as if afloat,
like some island of the south, in a great warm sea
that made, for every conceivable chance, a margin,
an outer sphere of general emotion; and the effect
of the occurrence of anything in particular was to
make the sea submerge the island, the margin flood
the text. The great wave now for a moment swept
over. "I'll go anywhere else in the world you
like."

have felt of her that she joked about it now, had not
her scale from grave to gay been a thing of such
unnamable shades that her contrasts were never
sharp. She made up for failures of gravity by failures
of mirth; if she hadn't, that is, been at times
as earnest as might have been liked, so she was certain
not to be at other times as easy as she would like
herself. "I must face the music. It isn't, at any

Milly neither accepted nor qualified this; she only
said, after a moment, as with a conscious excess of
the pensive: "No, I don't think she'd quite wish to
suggest that I made up to <i>him;</i> for that I should have
had to do so would only bring out his constancy. All
I mean is," she added—and now at last, as with a
supreme impatience "that her being able to make
him out a little a person who could give cause for
jealousy would evidently help her, since she's afraid
of him, to do him in her sister's mind a useful ill
turn."

gracefully even on one of her own New England

that was what New England heroines did, and it
was moreover interesting for the moment to make
out how many really her young friend had undertaken
to see round. Finally, too, weren't they braving
the deeps? They got their amusement where
they could. "Isn't it only," she asked, "rather
