Chapter 11: The National Gallery Tryst
Milly finds Merton Densher at the National Gallery, a moment of unexpected "connection" amidst the high-culture setting of London.

Visual Concept: Soft, dappled light inside the grand, high-ceilinged National Gallery. Milly and Densher are small figures surrounded by massive, blurred gold-framed paintings. The atmosphere is one of hushed intimacy and "intellectual" air.

Chapter 12: The Palace of Art
Milly contemplates her "success" in London society and the "magnificence" of her new surroundings, while internally grappling with her health.

Visual Concept: A rich, hazy interior at Lancaster Gate. Milly is enveloped in soft, shimmering fabrics, appearing almost ethereal. Broad brushstrokes of gold and rose dominate, reflecting her status as the "social princess" of the season.

Chapter 13: Sir Luke Strett’s Consulting Room
Milly visits the famous doctor, Sir Luke Strett. The tone shifts to one of "clinical" gravity hidden beneath supreme kindness.

Visual Concept: A more somber, cool palette—silvery greys and deep blues. A professional but elegant room. Milly faces the doctor, whose presence is "massive" and "reassuring," while the "shabby" London light outside the window feels distant and uncaring.

Chapter 14: The Walk in the Fog
Densher and Kate walk through a London "pea-souper" fog, discussing their secret plan and the "value" of Milly's affection.

Visual Concept: Thick, yellowish-grey fog that blurs everything but the two dark silhouettes of Kate and Densher. Street lamps appear as soft, glowing orbs of orange light. The mood is secretive, heavy, and "oppressive".

Chapter 15: Milly's Solitary Drive
Following her medical news, Milly takes a carriage ride through the city to "absorb" the life of the common people.

Visual Concept: A view from inside a carriage looking out at a blurred, rainy London street. Milly’s face is reflected in the damp glass. Flickering colors of wet pavement, colorful umbrellas, and the "vibration" of the busy city life she fears losing.

Chapter 16: The Pact at the Museum
Kate and Densher solidify their "understanding" at a museum, a place of silent witnesses to their evolving scheme.

Visual Concept: Cool, stony colors—marbles and shadows. Kate and Densher stand between ancient statues, their faces close in a "conspiratorial" whisper. The contrast between the timeless, cold stone and their "warm, living" deception.
