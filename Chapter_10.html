<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Lord Mark visited Milly and Susan Shepherd at their hotel on several occasions. He then brought them to a social gathering at a large historic house.</p><p>At the gathering, Milly was introduced to new people and walked through the house's halls. She accepted and drank a cup of iced coffee. During this time, Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud) told Milly she must stay with them and could stay in any position she wished.</p><p>Milly and Mrs. Lowder observed Kate Croy. Milly told Mrs. Lowder that Kate was the handsomest person there, lovely, and always right. Mrs. Lowder agreed that Kate was a luxury to have. As they talked, Lord Mark passed and repassed before them. A servant took Milly's empty ice-plate.</p><p>Mrs. Lowder continued speaking to Milly, urging her to make her home with them, to let them take care of her, and to help with Kate. She stated that Milly and Kate must stand together because together they could do anything, and that her plans for Kate also required Milly's prosperity.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Lord Mark**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** He is presented as a persistent and subtly manipulative social operator. He seeks validation from Milly, wanting her to acknowledge his importance. He orchestrates the grand social experience for the women, acting as a "supervisory friend" while making it clear, non-verbally, that Milly is the true reason for his efforts. He is a key component in Mrs. Lowder's social maneuvering, a valuable piece she is "working in" to her design.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** His intention to impress Milly and correct her "injustice" has succeeded. He has successfully engineered a situation that has charmed her and created a "friendly understanding" between them, shifting him from a mere pursuer to an effective social power player in her eyes.</li>
<li>*Milly**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is highly observant, introspective, and impressionable, though with a sharp underlying awareness. She is physically described as a "poor shaky maiden" but possesses a rich internal life, viewing the social scene with a mix of awe and analytical curiosity. She feels overwhelmed by the grandeur but is perceptive enough to see the machinations of Lord Mark and Mrs. Lowder.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically from being a guest at a party to becoming its focal point. Mrs. Lowder explicitly tells her she "is the matter," and that she can have any position she wants. This moves her from a passive observer to the designated centerpiece of the social plan, a realization that serves as a "climax" for her.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is a powerful, effusive, and strategic woman, described as a "natural force." She is in a state of high satisfaction, seeing her plans and affections align. She uses grand, persuasive language to envelop Milly in her designs, seeing the girl's prosperity as essential to her niece Kate's. She is actively weaving the people around her into a "free and genial" but definite plan.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her plans "enlarge and uplift." Having successfully brought Milly into this grand setting, she shifts from mere hospitality to an open campaign to secure Milly's permanent place within her circle, making her happiness and future integral to the family's social success.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is presented through Milly’s admiring perspective as a beautiful, enigmatic, and socially perfect figure. She has the ability to appear as a "beautiful stranger," making her a constant subject of curiosity. Milly sees her as being "made for great social uses" and always "so right." For Mrs. Lowder, she is a prized asset, a "luxury to take about the world."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation is not shifted directly but is powerfully reinforced. The successful integration of Milly into their circle solidifies Kate’s own position, as Mrs. Lowder’s plan now requires both young women to prosper together.</li>
<li>*Susan Shepherd (Susie)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is a gentle, secondary figure who is valued for her role as a connector. Lord Mark is merely "civil" to her, and Mrs. Lowder views her sentimentally as a miraculously restored old friend, kept "in lavender and pink paper." Her main function in the scene is as the catalyst for the friendship between Milly and Kate.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** There is no shift in her situation; she remains a static, pleasant presence who appreciates the experience on behalf of the group.</li></ul>

<p>
Lord Mark looked at her to-day in particular
as if to wring from her a confession
that she had originally done him injustice;
and he was entitled to whatever there might be
in it of advantage or merit that his intention really
in a manner took effect: he cared about something,
that is, after all, sufficiently to make her
feel absurdly as if she <i>were</i> confessing—all the
while it was quite the case that neither justice
nor injustice was what had been in question between
them. He had presented himself at the hotel,
had found her and had found Susan Shepherd at
home, had been "civil" to Susan—it was just that
shade, and Susan's fancy had fondly caught it; and
then had come again and missed them, and then had
come and found them once more: besides letting
them easily see that if it hadn't by this time been the
end of everything—which they could feel in the exhausted
air, that of the season at its last gasp—the
places they might have liked to go to were such as
they would have had only to mention. Their feeling
was—or at any rate their modest general plea—that
there was no place they would have liked to go to;
there was only the sense of finding they liked, wherever
they were, the place to which they had been
brought. Such was highly the case as to their current
consciousness—which could be indeed, in an
equally eminent degree, but a matter of course; impressions
this afternoon having by a happy turn of
their wheel been gathered for them into a splendid
cluster, an offering like an armful of the rarest
flowers. They were in presence of the offering—they
had been led up to it; and if it had been still
their habit to look at each other across distances for
increase of unanimity his hand would have been silently
named between them as the hand applied to the
wheel. He had administered the touch that, under
light analysis, made the difference—the difference of
their not having lost, as Susie on the spot and at
the hour phrased it again and again, both for herself
and for such others as the question might concern,
so beautiful and interesting an experience; the difference
also, in fact, of Mrs. Lowder's not having
lost it either, though it was with Mrs. Lowder, superficially,
they had come, and though it was further
with that lady that our young woman was directly
engaged during the half-hour or so of her most
agreeably inward response to the scene.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Lord Mark focused on her that day, as if trying to force her to admit she'd wronged him. He acted as though he deserved something, a benefit or reward, from what had happened, as if his intention had actually mattered. He cared enough about the situation to make her feel foolish, as if she were confessing something, even though their relationship hadn't been about fairness or unfairness. He'd shown up at the hotel, found her and Susan Shepherd at home, and been "polite" to Susan – just that little bit of charm had caught Susan's attention. He'd returned, missed them, and then found them again. He also made it clear that if it wasn't the very end of the social season, which they all felt in the weary atmosphere, the places they might have wanted to go were places they could have easily suggested. They felt – or at least, their usual humble position was – that they didn't want to go anywhere. They simply enjoyed where they were, wherever they'd been brought. This was especially true of how they were feeling at that moment. The afternoon's experiences had, by a lucky turn, come together beautifully, like a stunning bouquet of rare flowers. They were appreciating this gift, they'd been led to it. If they still relied on shared glances to confirm their agreement, they would silently credit him for making it all happen. His influence had, upon closer inspection, made the difference – the difference of not having missed, as Susan kept saying to herself and anyone who would listen, such a wonderful and engaging experience. He'd also prevented Mrs. Lowder from missing it, even though they'd superficially come with Mrs. Lowder, and even though the young woman was directly occupied with Mrs. Lowder during the half-hour or so of her most pleasant inward enjoyment of the scene.</i></p></div>

<p>
The great historic house had, for Milly, beyond
terrace and garden, as the centre of an almost extravagantly
grand Watteau-composition, a tone as
of old gold kept "down" by the quality of the air,
summer full-flushed, but attuned to the general perfect
taste. Much, by her measure, for the previous
hour, appeared, in connection with this revelation of
it, to have happened to her—a quantity expressed in
introductions of charming new people, in walks
through halls of armour, of pictures, of cabinets, of
tapestry, of tea-tables, in an assault of reminders
that this largeness of style was the sign of <i>appointed</i>
felicity. The largeness of style was the great containing
vessel, while everything else, the pleasant
personal affluence, the easy, murmurous welcome,
the honoured age of illustrious host and hostess, all
at once so distinguished and so plain, so public and
so shy, became but this or that element of the infusion.
The elements melted together and seasoned
the draught, the essence of which might have struck
the girl as distilled into the small cup of iced coffee
she had vaguely accepted from somebody, while a
fuller flood, somehow, kept bearing her up—all the
freshness of response of her young life the freshness
of the first and only prime. What had perhaps
brought on just now a kind of climax was the fact
of her appearing to make out, through Aunt Maud,
what was really the matter. It couldn't be less than
a climax for a poor shaky maiden to find it put to
her of a sudden that she herself was the matter—for
that was positively what, on Mrs. Lowder's part, it
came to. Everything was great, of course, in great
pictures, and it was doubtless precisely a part of the
brilliant life—since the brilliant life, as one had faintly
figured it, clearly <i>was</i> humanly led—that all impressions
within its area partook of its brilliancy;
still, letting that pass, it fairly stamped an hour as
with the official seal for one to be able to take in so
comfortably one's companion's broad blandness.
"You must stay among us—you must stay; anything
else is impossible and ridiculous; you don't
know yet, no doubt—you can't; but you will soon
enough: you can stay in <i>any</i> position." It had been
as the murmurous consecration to follow the murmurous
welcome; and even if it were but part of
Aunt Maud's own spiritual ebriety—for the dear
woman, one could see, was spiritually "keeping"
the day—it served to Milly, then and afterwards, as
a high-water mark of the imagination.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>For Milly, the grand old house, extending beyond the terrace and garden, was the heart of a scene that resembled an elaborate painting by Watteau. The atmosphere had the muted richness of antique gold, softened by the summer air, which was vibrant but in perfect harmony with the overall elegance. A great deal had happened to her in the past hour, connected to this realization of the house’s significance. There were introductions to delightful new people, tours through rooms filled with suits of armor, paintings, elaborate display cabinets, tapestries, and tea tables. These experiences were a barrage of reminders that this grand style was a sign of future happiness.</i></p><p><i>The grand style was the central element, the main container. Everything else – the comfortable wealth, the warm welcome, the respected age of her famous hosts, who were both refined and unpretentious, public yet reserved – became components of this atmosphere. These elements blended and flavored the overall feeling, the core of which might have felt concentrated in the small cup of iced coffee she’d casually accepted from someone. Meanwhile, a broader sense of support sustained her – the fresh responsiveness of her young life, at its peak.</i></p><p><i>What had possibly triggered a sort of peak moment was the fact that she realized, through Aunt Maud, what the real issue was. It was a definite climax for a nervous, young woman to suddenly understand that *she* was the problem—that’s exactly what Mrs. Lowder’s words implied. Everything was, of course, magnificent, reflected in the great paintings. And undoubtedly, since a brilliant life was, as she had imagined it, a human experience, all the impressions within its sphere took on its brilliance.</i></p><p><i>Still, overlooking that, it really marked the hour as official when one could accept her companion’s broad, pleasant assurance. "You must stay with us – you must stay; anything else is impossible and ridiculous. You don't know yet, of course – you can't, but you will soon enough. You can stay in any role." It was the whispered blessing following the whispered welcome. And even if it was just part of Aunt Maud's own slightly intoxicated happiness—because she was clearly enjoying the day—it served Milly, then and later, as a high point of her imagination.</i></p></div>

It was to be the end of the short parenthesis which
had begun but the other day at Lancaster Gate with
Lord Mark's informing her that she was a "success"—the
key thus again struck; and though no
distinct, no numbered revelations had crowded in,
there had, as we have seen, been plenty of incident
for the space and the time. There had been thrice
as much, and all gratuitous and genial—if, in portions,
not exactly hitherto <i>the</i> revelation—as three
unprepared weeks could have been expected to produce.
Mrs. Lowder had improvised a "rush" for
them, but out of elements, as Milly was now a little
more freely aware, somewhat roughly combined.
Therefore if at this very instant she had her reasons
for thinking of the parenthesis as about to close—reasons
completely personal—she had on behalf of
her companion a divination almost as deep. The
parenthesis would close with this admirable picture,
but the admirable picture still would show Aunt
Maud as not absolutely sure either if she herself were
destined to remain in it. What she was doing,
Milly might even not have escaped seeming to see,
was to talk herself into a sublimer serenity while she
ostensibly talked Milly. It was fine, the girl fully
felt, the way she did talk <i>her,</i> little as, at bottom, our
young woman needed it or found other persuasions
at fault. It was in particular during the minutes of
her grateful absorption of iced coffee—qualified by
a sharp doubt of her wisdom—that she most had in
view Lord Mark's relation to her being there, or at
least to the question of her being amused at it. It
wouldn't have taken much by the end of five minutes
quite to make her feel that this relation was charming.
It might, once more, simply have been that
everything, anything, was charming when one was so
justly and completely charmed; but, frankly, she had
not supposed anything so serenely sociable could define
itself between them as the friendly understanding
that was at present somehow in the air. They were,
many of them together, near the marquee that had
been erected on a stretch of sward as a temple of refreshment
and that happened to have the property—which
was all to the good of making Milly think
of a "durbar"; her iced coffee had been a consequence
of this connection, in which, further, the
bright company scattered about fell thoroughly into
place. Certain of its members might have represented
the contingent of "native princes"—familiar,
but scarce the less grandly gregarious term!—and
Lord Mark would have done for one of these even
though for choice he but presented himself as a
supervisory friend of the family. The Lancaster
Gate family, he clearly intended, in which he included
its American recruits, and included above all Kate
Croy—a young person blessedly easy to take care of.
She knew people, and people knew her, and she was
the handsomest thing there—this last a declaration
made by Milly, in a sort of soft mid-summer madness,
a straight skylark-flight of charity, to Aunt
Maud.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>This was supposed to be the end of the brief interlude that had begun just the other day at Lancaster Gate when Lord Mark told her she was a "success"—the key had been struck again. Although there hadn't been any clear, distinct revelations, there had been plenty of events for the time they'd had. There had been even more, all of it free and friendly—though perhaps not entirely revelatory—than one would have expected from just three weeks. Mrs. Lowder had arranged a "rush" of activities for them, but as Milly was starting to realize, the elements were somewhat haphazardly thrown together. So, if she now felt that this interlude was about to end—for completely personal reasons—she also had a strong sense of what her companion was thinking. The interlude would end with this wonderful gathering, but even here, Aunt Maud still seemed unsure if she herself would stay involved. Milly might even have sensed that Aunt Maud was essentially talking herself into a greater calm while ostensibly talking to Milly. It was impressive, Milly thought, the way Aunt Maud spoke to her, even though, deep down, Milly didn't really need the advice and wasn't finding other arguments compelling. It was especially while she gratefully sipped her iced coffee—though with a slight doubt about her own judgment—that she most considered Lord Mark's interest in her being there, or at least the question of whether she was amused by it. Within five minutes, it wouldn't have taken much to make her feel that his interest was charming. It might simply have been that everything, anything, was charming when one was so truly and completely charmed, but, frankly, she hadn't expected such a serenely social connection to develop between them, such as the friendly understanding that was currently in the air. Many of them were gathered near the marquee that had been set up on the lawn as a place for refreshments, and it happened to make Milly think of a "durbar" [a formal gathering], which led her to order iced coffee, and also made the bright company scattered about fit perfectly into the scene. Certain members of the group might have represented the contingent of "native princes"—a familiar, yet still impressively grand term!—and Lord Mark would have been one of them, even though he preferred to present himself as a supportive friend of the family. He clearly intended to include the Lancaster Gate family in this, which meant including its American newcomers, and above all, Kate Croy—a young woman who was blessedly easy to look after. Kate knew people, and people knew her, and she was the most beautiful person there—this was a declaration Milly made to Aunt Maud, in a sort of soft, summer-like moment of pure generosity.</i></p></div>
</details>
</div><div class="section-block">
<div class="original-text">
<p>
Kate had, for her new friend's eyes, the extraordinary
and attaching property of appearing at a given
moment to show as a beautiful stranger, to cut her
connections and lose her identity, letting the imagination
for the time make what it would of them—make
her merely a person striking from afar, more
and more pleasing as one watched, but who was
above all a subject for curiosity. Nothing could
have given her, as a party to a relation, a greater
freshness than this sense—which sprang up at its
own hours—of being as curious about her as if one
hadn't known her. It had sprung up, we have gathered,
as soon as Milly had seen her after hearing
from Mrs. Stringham of her knowledge of Merton
Densher; she had <i>looked</i> then other and, as Milly
knew the real critical mind would call it, more objective;
and our young woman had foreseen it of
her, on the spot, that she would often look so again.
It was exactly what she was doing this afternoon;
and Milly, who had amusements of thought that
were like the secrecies of a little girl playing with
dolls when conventionally "too big," could almost
settle to the game of what one would suppose her,
how one would place her, if one didn't know her.
She became thus, intermittently, a figure conditioned
only by the great facts of aspect, a figure to be waited
for, named and fitted. This was doubtless but a
way of feeling that it was of her essence to be peculiarly
what the occasion, whatever it might be, demanded
when its demand was highest. There were
probably ways enough, on these lines, for such a consciousness;
another of them would be, for instance,
to say that she was made for great social uses. Milly
was not wholly sure that she herself knew what great
social uses might be—unless, as a good example,
exerting just that sort of glamour in just that sort
of frame were one of them: she would have fallen
back on knowing sufficiently that they existed at all
events for her friend. It imputed a primness, all
round, to be reduced but to saying, by way of a translation
of one's amusement, that she was always so
<i>right</i>—since that, too often, was what the <i>insupportables</i>
themselves were; yet it was, in overflow to
Aunt Maud, what she had to content herself withal—save
for the lame enhancement of saying she was
lovely. It served, all the same, the purpose, strengthened
the bond that for the time held the two ladies
together, distilled in short its drop of rose-colour for
Mrs. Lowder's own view. That was really the view
Milly had, for most of the rest of the occasion, to
give herself to immediately taking in; but it didn't
prevent the continued play of those swift cross-lights,
odd beguilements of the mind, at which we
have already glanced.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate had a remarkable and captivating quality that, to her new friend, was like a beautiful stranger appearing at any given moment. She could detach herself, lose her usual identity, and allow the imagination to run wild. She became a figure intriguing from afar, more and more appealing the longer one watched her, but ultimately someone to be studied with curiosity. Nothing could have given her a more refreshing quality in a relationship than this feeling—which arose unexpectedly—of being as curious about herself as if she were a complete mystery. This had appeared, we've gathered, as soon as Milly saw her after hearing from Mrs. Stringham about her relationship with Merton Densher.

It still served its purpose, strengthened the bond between the two ladies, and distilled a touch of rose-colored admiration for Mrs. Lowder's own view.

Mrs. Lowder herself found it enough simply to
reply, in respect to Kate, that she was indeed a luxury
to take about the world: she expressed no
more surprise than that at her "rightness" to-day.
Wasn't it by this time sufficiently manifest that it
was precisely as the very luxury she was proving
that she had, from far back, been appraised and
waited for? Crude elation, however, might be kept
at bay, and the circumstance none the less demonstrated
that they were all swimming together in the
blue. It came back to Lord Mark again, as he
seemed slowly to pass and repass and conveniently
to linger before them; he was personally the note
of the blue—like a suspended skein of silk within
reach of the broiderer's hand. Aunt Maud's free-moving
shuttle took a length of him at rhythmic intervals;
and one of the intermixed truths that flickered
across to Milly was that he ever so consentingly
knew he was being worked in. This was almost like
an understanding with her at Mrs. Lowder's expense,
which she would have none of; she wouldn't
for the world have had him make any such point as
that he wouldn't have launched them at Matcham—or
whatever it was he <i>had</i> done—only for Aunt
Maud's <i>beaux yeux.</i> What he had done, it would
have been guessable, was something he had for some
time been desired in vain to do; and what they were
all now profiting by was a change comparatively sudden,
the cessation of hope delayed. What had
caused the cessation easily showed itself as none of
Milly's business; and she was luckily, for that matter,
in no real danger of hearing from him directly
that her individual weight had been felt in the scale.
Why then indeed was it an effect of his diffused but
subdued participation that he might absolutely have
been saying to her "Yes, let the dear woman take
her own tone? Since she's here she may stay," he
might have been adding—"for whatever she can
make of it. But you and I are different." Milly
knew <i>she</i> was different in truth—his own difference
was his own affair; but also she knew that, after all,
even at their distinctest, Lord Mark's "tips" in this
line would be tacit. He practically placed her—it
came round again to that—under no obligation
whatever. It was a matter of equal ease, moreover,
her letting Mrs. Lowder take a tone. She might
have taken twenty—they would have spoiled nothing.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Mrs. Lowder simply said, about Kate, that she was a luxury to have around. She wasn't surprised by Kate's "perfection" that day. Wasn't it clear by now that Kate was valued and anticipated precisely *because* she was a luxury? Any obvious excitement could be kept under wraps, but the situation still showed that they were all on the same page. Lord Mark kept circling back, lingering nearby. He was the epitome of their shared goal – like a silken thread waiting to be woven. Aunt Maud, with her constant maneuvering, was subtly incorporating him into her plan. Milly realized that he was willingly cooperating, almost as if he knew he was being used. This felt almost like a secret agreement at Mrs. Lowder's expense, and Milly wanted none of it. She wouldn't have wanted him to imply that he only helped them, by launching them at Matcham or whatever he'd done, because Aunt Maud wanted it. What he had done, one could assume, was something he'd been asked to do for a while; and what they were now benefiting from was a relatively sudden shift, the end of a long wait. What caused this change was none of Milly's business, and she was lucky not to have to hear from him directly that her influence had been noticed.</i></p><p><i>Still, it felt like his unspoken contribution was that he might as well have been saying to her, "Yes, let the dear woman have her say.

But she also knew that, even at their most discreet, Lord Mark's unspoken opinions on the matter would remain subtle. Essentially, he was making it clear, again, that she owed him nothing. It was equally easy for her to allow Mrs. Lowder to set the tone. She could have taken twenty different tones – it wouldn't have changed a thing.</i></p></div>

"You must stay on with us; you <i>can,</i> you know,
in any position you like; any, any, <i>any,</i> my dear
child"—and her emphasis went deep. "You must
make your home with us; and it's really open to you
to make the most beautiful one in the world. You
mustn't be under a mistake—under any of any sort;
and you must let us all think for you a little, take
care of you and watch over you. Above all you must
help me with Kate, and you must stay a little <i>for</i>
her; nothing for a long time has happened to me so
good as that you and she should have become friends.
It's beautiful; it's great; it's everything. What
makes it perfect is that it should have come about
through our dear delightful Susie, restored to me,
after so many years, by such a miracle. No—that's
more charming to me than even your hitting it off
with Kate. God has been good to one—positively;
for I couldn't, at my age, have made a new friend—undertaken,
I mean, out of whole cloth, the real
thing. It's like changing one's bankers—after fifty:
one doesn't do that. That's why Susie has been
kept for me, as you seem to keep people in your wonderful
country, in lavender and pink paper—coming
back at last as straight as out of a fairy-tale and with
you as an attendant fairy." Milly hereupon replied
appreciatively that such a description of herself made
her feel as if pink paper were her dress and lavender
its trimming; but Aunt Maud was not to be deterred
by a weak joke from keeping it up. Her interlocutress
could feel besides that she kept it up in perfect
sincerity. She was somehow at this hour a very
happy woman, and a part of her happiness might
precisely have been that her affections and her views
were moving as never before in concert. Unquestionably
she loved Susie; but she also loved Kate
and loved Lord Mark, loved their funny old host and
hostess, loved every one within range, down to the
very servant who came to receive Milly's empty iceplate—down,
for that matter, to Milly herself, who
was, while she talked, really conscious of the enveloping
flap of a protective mantle, a shelter with the
weight of an eastern carpet. An eastern carpet, for
wishing-purposes of one's own, was a thing to be on
rather than under; still, however, if the girl should
fail of breath it wouldn't be, she could feel, by Mrs.
Lowder's fault. One of the last things she was
afterwards to recall of this was Aunt Maud's going
on to say that she and Kate must stand together because
together they could do anything. It was for
Kate of course she was essentially planning; but the
plan, enlarged and uplifted now, somehow required
Milly's prosperity too for its full operation, just as
Milly's prosperity at the same time involved Kate's.
It was nebulous yet, it was slightly confused, but it
was unmistakably free and genial, and it made our
young woman understand things Kate had said of
her aunt's possibilities as well as characterisations
that had fallen from Susan Shepherd. One of the
most frequent on the lips of the latter had been that
dear Maud was a natural force.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"You absolutely have to stay with us. You can, you know. You can have any role you want, any, any, any, my dear. She really emphasized that. You need to make this your home, and honestly, you could make the most wonderful home imaginable. Please don't misunderstand me, not in any way. You should let us help you with some things, take care of you, and look out for you. Most importantly, you need to help me with Kate, and you have to stay for her sake. It's been the best thing to happen to me in a long time that you and she have become friends. It's beautiful, it's amazing, it's everything. What makes it perfect is that it happened because of our dear, delightful Susie, who came back to me after all these years, it was a miracle! No, that's even more delightful to me than you and Kate getting along so well. I've been blessed, truly. I couldn't, at my age, have made a new friend – I mean, have created a genuine, new friendship out of nothing. It's like changing your bank after fifty; you just don't do that. That's why Susie was kept for me, just like you seem to keep people in your wonderful country, in lavender and pink paper, returning at last, straight out of a fairy tale and with you as the attendant fairy."</i></p><p><i>Milly responded appreciatively, saying that the description made her feel like she was wearing a pink paper dress with lavender trim. But Aunt Maud wasn't going to let a silly joke stop her. Milly could also tell that Aunt Maud was being completely sincere. Somehow, at that moment, she was a very happy woman, and part of her happiness might have been that her feelings and her goals were working together like never before. She undoubtedly loved Susie, but she also loved Kate and Lord Mark, loved their funny old hosts, loved everyone around her, even the servant who took Milly's empty ice cream plate – even Milly herself, who, as she talked, felt the comforting weight of a protective shield, like being wrapped in a heavy, oriental rug. While you'd rather be on top of an oriental rug than under it, still, if the girl needed help, it wouldn't be because of Mrs. Lowder, she could feel. One of the last things Milly would later remember from this conversation was Aunt Maud saying that she and Kate needed to stick together because they could do anything together. She was essentially planning for Kate, of course, but the plan, expanded and elevated now, somehow required Milly's success as well, and Milly's success at the same time involved Kate's. It was unclear yet, a little confusing, but it was undoubtedly open and friendly, and it made Milly understand things Kate had said about her aunt's capabilities and the things that Susan Shepherd had said. One of Susan Shepherd's most common sayings had been that dear Maud was a force of nature.</i></p></div>
