<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Milly meets Mrs. Stringham and asks if they can leave their current location the next morning instead of stopping there. Mrs. Stringham agrees.</p><p>Later, Milly asks Mrs. Stringham what Dr. Finch said to her in a private meeting in New York. Mrs. Stringham replies that the doctor said nothing of consequence. Milly admits she only guessed that the meeting took place. A conversation follows in which Mrs. Stringham asks if Milly is unwell. Milly says she is not in pain but makes several cryptic comments about her life and happiness. When Mrs. Stringham offers to find a doctor, Milly says she will decide on their destination at supper, and then leaves the room.</p><p>At supper, Milly announces she wants to go to London. Mrs. Stringham mentions a potential acquaintance there, Mr. Merton Densher, but Milly says he is still in America. Mrs. Stringham then speaks of her own estranged school friend, Maud Manningham (now Mrs. Lowder), who lives in London and suggests she might try to contact her. Milly encourages her to do so and then goes to bed. Alone, Mrs. Stringham gets out her portfolio and writes a letter.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study.</p><p>### Milly Theale
</p><ul><li>**Presentation:** Milly is introduced as deeply preoccupied and forgetful, signs of a significant internal state that soon surfaces. She is enigmatic and speaks in evasive, almost poetic metaphors when questioned about her well-being, describing her potential ailment as an inability to "resist the bliss of what I have." This behavior perplexes and concerns her companion. She has a "constant white face" but also a "mocking light" in her expression, suggesting a complex mix of physical fragility and sharp intelligence.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Milly abruptly moves from a state of passive unease to decisive action. She engineers an immediate change in their travel plans, first urging a departure and then, after a tense and indirect conversation about her health, declaring a specific destination: London. Her stated reason is a sudden, urgent desire for "people," which she connects to a sense that her time may be limited. Her feigned forgetfulness and subsequent contradictory statements about Mr. Densher suggest he is an unstated, significant motive for this shift.</li><p>### Mrs. Stringham (Susan Shepherd)
</p><li>**Presentation:** Mrs. Stringham is presented as an intensely observant, intuitive, and accommodating companion. She instantly perceives Milly's distress and agrees to her wishes without question, attempting to ease the situation with gentle humor. She is startled and frightened by Milly’s abrupt questions about the doctor, revealing a protective and deeply caring nature. While she is often "put off" and confused by Milly's cryptic manner, her primary response is always one of earnest, tender concern.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Initially a responsive caretaker reacting to Milly's moods, Mrs. Stringham is spurred into a proactive role by the decision to go to London. She seizes the opportunity to propose reconnecting with a long-lost school friend, Maud Lowder. This practical suggestion is revealed to be driven by a more personal motivation: a desire for "poetic justice" after feeling socially "shunted" by Maud years ago. Milly becomes her "trophy," and Mrs. Stringham ends the scene by immediately taking action and writing a letter, shifting from follower to facilitator.</li></ul>

The girl said nothing, when they met, about the
words scrawled on the Tauchnitz, and Mrs. Stringham
then noticed that she had not the book with
her. She had left it lying and probably would
never remember it at all. Her comrade's decision
was therefore quickly made not to speak of having
followed her; and within five minutes of her return,
wonderfully enough, the preoccupation denoted by
her forgetfulness further declared itself. "Should
you think me quite abominable if I were to say that
after all——?"
</p>

She'd left it somewhere and probably wouldn't even remember it. So, Mrs. Stringham quickly decided not to say anything about having followed her. Amazingly, within five minutes of the girl returning, her forgetfulness indicated she was still preoccupied. "Would you think I'm awful if I said that, after all...?"</i></p></div>

Mrs. Stringham had already thought, with the
first sound of the question, everything she was capable
of thinking, and had immediately made such a
sign that Milly's words gave place to visible relief
at her assent. "You don't care for our stop here—you'd
rather go straight on? We'll start then
with the peep of to-morrow's dawn—or as early as
you like; it's only rather late now to take the road
again." And she smiled to show how she meant it
for a joke that an instant onward rush was what the
girl would have wished. "I bullied you into stopping,"
she added; "so it serves me right."
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>As soon as Mrs. Stringham heard the question, she'd already considered everything she possibly could, and quickly signaled her agreement. Milly's expression visibly relaxed when she saw this. "You don't want to stay here – you'd rather go straight on? We can leave at dawn tomorrow – or whenever you like. It's just a little late to travel now." And she smiled, as if to suggest that the girl actually wanted to rush off immediately. "I forced you to stop," she added, "so I deserve this."</i></p></div>

<p>
Milly made in general the most of her good
friend's jokes; but she humoured this one a little
absently. "Oh yes, you do bully me." And it
was thus arranged between them, with no discussion
at all, that they would resume their journey in
the morning. The younger tourist's interest in the
detail of the matter—in spite of a declaration from
the elder that she would consent to be dragged anywhere—appeared
almost immediately afterwards
quite to lose itself; she promised, however, to think
till supper of where, with the world all before them,
they might go—supper having been ordered for
such time as permitted of lighted candles. It had
been agreed between them that lighted candles at
wayside inns, in strange countries, amid mountain
scenery, gave the evening meal a peculiar poetry—such
being the mild adventures, the refinements of
impression, that they, as they would have said, went
in for. It was now as if, before this repast, Milly
had designed to "lie down"; but at the end of
three minutes more she was not lying down, she
was saying instead, abruptly, with a transition that
was like a jump of four thousand miles: "What
was it that, in New York, on the ninth, when you
saw him alone, Dr. Finch said to you?"
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly usually enjoyed her friend's jokes, but she responded to this one with a bit of a distracted air. "Oh yes, you do pick on me." And that's how it was settled between them, without any argument, that they'd continue their trip the next day. The younger woman's curiosity about the specifics of their plans – even though the older woman had said she'd go anywhere – seemed to vanish almost instantly. However, she promised to consider where they might go, with the whole world open to them, until dinner. Dinner had been scheduled for when they could have candles. They'd agreed that lit candles in country inns, in foreign lands, surrounded by mountains, added a special beauty to their evening meals – these were the subtle thrills, the heightened experiences they loved. Now, as if before the meal, Milly had been about to "lie down" for a nap, but three minutes later, she wasn't lying down. Instead, she said suddenly, shifting topics as if she’d teleported across the world: "What did Dr. Finch say to you in New York on the ninth, when you saw him alone?"</i></p></div>

<p>
It was not till later that Mrs. Stringham fully
knew why the question had startled her still more
than its suddenness explained; though the effect of
it even at the moment was almost to frighten her
into a false answer. She had to think, to remember
the occasion, the "ninth," in New York, the time
she had seen Dr. Finch alone, and to recall what
he had then said to her; and when everything had
come back it was quite, at first, for a moment, as
if he had said something that immensely mattered.
He hadn't, however, in fact; it was only as if he
might perhaps after all have been going to. It
was on the sixth—within ten days of their sailing—that
she had hurried from Boston under the
alarm, a small but a sufficient shock, of hearing that
Mildred had suddenly been taken ill, had had, from
some obscure cause, such an upset as threatened to
stay their journey. The bearing of the accident
had happily soon announced itself as slight, and
there had been, in the event, but a few hours of anxiety;
the journey had been pronounced again not
only possible, but, as representing "change," highly
advisable; and if the zealous guest had had five
minutes by herself with the doctor, that was, clearly,
no more at his instance than at her own. Almost
nothing had passed between them but an easy exchange
of enthusiasms in respect to the remedial
properties of "Europe"; and this assurance, as the
facts came back to her, she was now able to give.
"Nothing whatever, on my word of honour, that
you mayn't know or mightn't then have known.
I've no secret with him about you. What makes
you suspect it? I don't quite make out how you
know I did see him alone."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Mrs. Stringham didn't understand why the question had surprised her so much, even more than its unexpectedness had. The question almost made her give the wrong answer out of fear. She had to pause, think back to the situation, the "ninth" in New York. That's when she had seen Dr. Finch by himself, and had to remember what he'd said to her then. When everything came back to her, it was as if he had said something incredibly important. But he hadn't, not really. It was only as if he possibly might have, in the end. It was on the sixth – within ten days of their departure – that she had rushed from Boston, alarmed, a small but significant shock, to hear that Mildred had suddenly fallen ill. Mildred had been hit with some mysterious sickness that threatened to make them cancel their trip. Luckily, the problem quickly proved not serious, and there were only a few hours of worry. The trip was declared possible again, and even highly recommended as a “change of scenery”. If the eager guest had had five minutes alone with the doctor, it was clearly because she wanted to, just as much as he did. Almost nothing was said between them, just an easy discussion of how amazing "Europe" was for recovery, and as she remembered, she could now confirm that. “Honestly, there was nothing you don’t know, or that you couldn’t have known back then. I have no secrets with him about you. Why do you suspect it? I'm not sure how you know I saw him alone.”</i></p></div>

was better—the last thing before you went home."

<i>"He</i> didn't himself—nor did you write me it
afterwards. We speak of it now for the first time.
That's exactly why!" Milly declared—with something
in her face and voice that, the next moment,
betrayed for her companion that she had really
known nothing, had only conjectured and, chancing
her charge, made a hit. Yet why had her mind
been busy with the question? "But if you're not,

The elder woman was earnest for the truth,
though the possibility she named was not at all the
one that seemed to fit—witness the long climb
Milly had just indulged in. The girl showed her
constant white face, but that her friends had all
learned to discount, and it was often brightest when
superficially not bravest. She continued for a little
mysteriously to smile. "I don't know—haven't
really the least idea. But it might be well to find
out."

Mrs. Stringham's eyes entreated her; she had
gone close to her, half enclosed her with urgent
arms. "Do you want to see some one?" And
then as the girl only met it with a slow headshake,
though looking perhaps a shade more conscious:
"We'll go straight to the best near doctor." This
too, however, produced but a gaze of qualified assent
and a silence, sweet and vague, that left everything
open. Our friend decidedly lost herself.

Milly had for the third time her air of consideration;
but she came back with it to her plea of some
minutes before. "I'll tell you at supper—good-bye
till then." And she left the room with a lightness
that testified for her companion to something
that again particularly pleased her in the renewed
promise of motion. The odd passage just concluded,
Mrs. Stringham mused as she once more sat
alone with a hooked needle and a ball of silk, the
"fine" work with which she was always provided—this
mystifying mood had simply been precipitated,
no doubt, by their prolonged halt, with which
the girl hadn't really been in sympathy. One had
only to admit that her complaint was in fact but the
excess of the joy of life, and everything <i>did</i> then
fit. She couldn't stop for the joy, but she could
go on for it, and with the sense of going on she
floated again, was restored to her great spaces.
There was no evasion of any truth—so at least
Susan Shepherd hoped—in one's sitting there while
the twilight deepened and feeling still more finely
that the position of this young lady was magnificent.
The evening at that height had naturally
turned to cold, and the travellers had bespoken a
fire with their meal; the great Alpine road asserted
its brave presence through the small panes of the
low, clean windows, with incidents at the inn-door,
the yellow <i>diligence,</i> the great waggons, the hurrying,
hooded, private conveyances, reminders, for
our fanciful friend, of old stories, old pictures, historic
flights, escapes, pursuits, things that had happened,
things indeed that by a sort of strange congruity
helped her to read the meanings of the
greatest interest into the relation in which she was
now so deeply involved. It was natural that this
record of the magnificence of her companion's position
should strike her as, after all, the best meaning
she could extract; for she herself was seated in
the magnificence as in a court-carriage—she came
back to that, and such a method of progression,
such a view from crimson cushions, would evidently
have a great deal more to give. By the time the
candles were lighted for supper and the short, white
curtains were drawn, Milly had reappeared, and the
little scenic room had then all its romance. That
charm moreover was far from broken by the words
in which she, without further loss of time, satisfied
her patient mate. "I want to go straight to London."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly adopted her thoughtful expression for the third time, but she immediately returned to her earlier request. "I'll tell you at supper—goodbye until then." She left the room with a carefree energy that suggested to her companion that something about the renewed promise of movement particularly pleased her. Mrs. Stringham pondered the strange conversation she'd just had as she sat alone again with her needle and silk, her "fine" needlework that she always kept with her. This puzzling mood, she thought, was probably just caused by their extended stop, which the girl hadn't really liked. You just had to accept that Milly's restlessness was actually an overflow of her joy for life, and then everything made sense. She couldn't pause for the joy, but she could continue moving for it, and the feeling of continuing allowed her to float again, returning her to a sense of freedom.

She herself was seated in this magnificence, as if in a fancy carriage—she kept returning to that image, and this method of travel, this view from luxurious cushions, would obviously offer her much more.</i></p><p><i>By the time the candles were lit for supper and the short, white curtains were drawn, Milly had returned, and the small, picturesque room was filled with romance. That charm was not diminished by the words with which she, without delay, satisfied her patient friend. "I want to go straight to London."</i></p></div>

It was unexpected, corresponding with no view
positively taken at their departure; when England
had appeared, on the contrary, rather relegated and
postponed—seen for the moment, as who should
say, at the end of an avenue of preparations and introductions.
London, in short, might have been
supposed to be the crown, and to be achieved like a
siege by gradual approaches. Milly's actual fine
stride was therefore the more exciting, as any simplification
almost always was to Mrs. Stringham;
who, besides, was afterwards to recall as the very
beginning of a drama the terms in which, between
their smoky candles, the girl had put her preference
and in which still other things had come up, come
while the clank of waggon-chains in the sharp air
reached their ears, with the stamp of hoofs, the rattle
of buckets and the foreign questions, foreign
answers, that were all alike a part of the cheery converse
of the road. The girl brought it out in truth
as she might have brought a huge confession, something
she admitted herself shy about and that would
seem to show her as frivolous; it had rolled over
her that what she wanted of Europe was "people,"
so far as they were to be had, and that if her friend
really wished to know, the vision of this same equivocal
quantity was what had haunted her during
their previous days, in museums and churches, and
what was again spoiling for her the pure taste of
scenery. She was all for scenery—yes; but she
wanted it human and personal, and all she could say
was that there would be in London—wouldn't
there? more of that kind than anywhere else. She
came back to her idea that if it wasn't for long—if
nothing should happen to be so for <i>her</i>—why, the
particular thing she spoke of would probably have
most to give her in the time, would probably be
less than anything else a waste of her remainder.
She produced this last consideration indeed with
such gaiety that Mrs. Stringham was not again disconcerted
by it, was in fact quite ready—if talk of
early dying was in order—to match it from her own
future. Good, then; they would, eat and drink because
of what might happen to-morrow; and they
would direct their course from that moment with a
view to such eating and drinking. They ate and
drank that night, in truth, as if in the spirit of this
decision; whereby the air, before they separated,
felt itself the clearer.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was surprising, because it wasn't what they'd planned when they left. England had seemed, in fact, to be put off, delayed—something that would come later, after all the preliminary steps. In other words, London was supposed to be the ultimate goal, something they'd reach gradually, like a city under siege. So, Milly's sudden, direct move there was even more exciting, as any shortcut always was to Mrs. Stringham. Mrs. Stringham also remembered this as the very beginning of a story, recalling the way the girl, by the light of their flickering candles, had expressed her preference. Other things came up too, as the sounds of wagon chains, horses' hooves, and buckets filled the cold air, along with the foreign questions and answers that were just part of the lively chatter of the road. The girl revealed it all almost as if it were a major confession, something she felt embarrassed about, as though it made her seem superficial. It had suddenly hit her that what she wanted from Europe, as much as possible, was "people." If her friend really wanted to know, the thought of these people was what had been on her mind during their earlier days, in museums and churches, and what was now ruining her enjoyment of the scenery. She did love the scenery, yes, but she wanted it to be connected to people, and all she could say was that there would be more of that in London—wouldn't there?—than anywhere else. She returned to her belief that if her time was short—if something happened to her—then this particular thing she was talking about would probably give her the most in the time she had left, and would probably be less of a waste of her remaining time than anything else. She said this last part so cheerfully that Mrs. Stringham wasn't upset by it, and, in fact, was ready—if talking about dying young was the subject—to offer her own similar thoughts about her own future. Fine, then; they would eat and drink because of what might happen tomorrow; and from that moment on, they would plan their trip with that goal in mind. They did eat and drink that night, as if they were truly committed to this decision; and before they separated, the air felt lighter.</i></p></div>

It had cleared perhaps to a view only too extensive—extensive,
that is, in proportion to the signs
of life presented. The idea of "people" was not
so entertained on Milly's part as to connect itself
with particular persons, and the fact remained for
each of the ladies that they would, completely unknown,
disembark at Dover amid the completely
unknowing. They had no relation already formed;
this plea Mrs. Stringham put forward to see what it
would produce. It produced nothing at first but
the observation on the girl's side that what she had
in mind was no thought of society nor of scraping
acquaintance; nothing was further from her than
to desire the opportunities represented for the compatriot
in general by a trunkful of "letters." It
wasn't a question, in short, of the people the compatriot
was after; it was the human, the English
picture itself, as they might see it in their own way—the
world imagined always in what one had read
and dreamed. Mrs. Stringham did every justice to
this world, but when later on an occasion chanced
to present itself, she made a point of not omitting
to remark that it might be a comfort to know in
advance even an individual. This still, however,
failed in vulgar parlance, to "fetch" Milly, so that
she had presently to go all the way. "Haven't I
understood from you, for that matter, that you gave
Mr. Densher something of a promise?"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The view had cleared, maybe a little *too* much. It was expansive, I mean, considering how few signs of life there were. Milly wasn't thinking about "people" in a way that involved specific individuals. The fact remained for both women: they would arrive in Dover, completely strangers, among people who didn't know them at all. They didn't have any connections yet. That was Mrs. Stringham's point, to see what would come of it. At first, it produced nothing except Milly's remark that she wasn't thinking about socializing or making small talk. Nothing could be further from her mind than pursuing the social opportunities that having a suitcase full of "letters" would bring to the average American. In short, she wasn't looking for the kinds of people an American might be after. She was interested in the human, English experience itself, how they might see it their own way—the world always imagined through what they had read and dreamed. Mrs. Stringham appreciated this perspective. But later, when the opportunity arose, she made it a point to say that it might be helpful to know even one person beforehand. This still, to put it plainly, didn't "click" with Milly. So Mrs. Stringham had to go further: "Didn't you tell me that you gave Mr. Densher some sort of a promise?"</i></p></div>
</details>
</div><div class="section-block">
<div class="original-text">
<p>
There was a moment, on this, when Milly's look
had to be taken as representing one of two things—either
that she was completely vague about the
promise or that Mr. Densher's name itself started
no train. But she really couldn't be so vague about
the promise, her interlocutress quickly saw, without
attaching it to something; it had to be a promise
to somebody in particular to be so repudiated. In
the event, accordingly, she acknowledged Mr. Merton
Densher, the so unusually clever young Englishman
who had made his appearance in New York
on some special literary business—wasn't it?—shortly
before their departure, and who had been
three or four times in her house during the
brief period between her visit to Boston and her
companion's subsequent stay with her; but she required
much reminding before it came back to her
that she had mentioned to this companion just
afterwards the confidence expressed by the personage
in question in her never doing so dire a thing
as to come to London without, as the phrase was,
looking a fellow up. She had left him the enjoyment
of his confidence, the form of which might have
appeared a trifle free—that she now reasserted; she
had done nothing either to impair or to enhance it;
but she had also left Mrs. Stringham, in the connection
and at the time, rather sorry to have missed Mr.
Densher. She had thought of him again after that,
the elder woman; she had likewise gone so far as to
notice that Milly appeared not to have done so—which
the girl might easily have betrayed; and, interested
as she was in everything that concerned
her, she had made out for herself, for herself only
and rather idly, that, but for interruptions, the
young Englishman might have become a better acquaintance.
His being an acquaintance at all was
one of the signs that in the first days had helped to
place Milly, as a young person with the world before
her, for sympathy and wonder. Isolated, unmothered,
unguarded, but with her other strong
marks, her big house, her big fortune, her big freedom,
she had lately begun to "receive," for all her
few years, as an older woman might have done—as
was done, precisely, by princesses who had public
considerations to observe and who came of age
very early. If it was thus distinct to Mrs. Stringham
then that Mr. Densher had gone off somewhere
else in connection with his errand before her
visit to New York, it had been also not undiscoverable
that he had come back for a day or two later on,
that is after her own second excursion—that he had
in fine reappeared on a single occasion on his way
to the West: his way from Washington as she believed,
though he was out of sight at the time of her
joining her friend for their departure. It had not
occurred to her before to exaggerate—it had not
occurred to her that she could; but she seemed to
become aware to-night that there had been just
enough in this relation to meet, to provoke, the
free conception of a little more.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>For a moment, it seemed Milly's reaction could mean one of two things: either she completely forgot about the promise, or the name "Mr. Densher" didn't ring any bells. However, her friend quickly realized Milly couldn't be so vague without linking the promise to something. It had to be a promise to a specific person to be rejected like that. So, Milly acknowledged Mr. Merton Densher, the exceptionally intelligent young Englishman who had arrived in New York for some literary work shortly before they left, and who had visited her several times during the short time between her trip to Boston and her companion's subsequent stay. But she needed a lot of prompting to remember that she'd mentioned to her companion afterward that Mr. Densher was confident she wouldn't do something so awful as come to London without, as they said, looking him up. Milly had let him enjoy that confidence, the casualness of which she now acknowledged. She hadn't done anything to encourage or discourage it. However, she also remembered that Mrs. Stringham, at the time, had been a bit disappointed to have missed Mr. Densher. The older woman had thought about him again later, and she had also noticed that Milly didn't seem to have given him any thought—something the girl could easily have revealed. Mrs. Stringham, being interested in everything related to Milly, had privately and somewhat casually concluded that, without interruptions, the young Englishman might have become a better friend. His being an acquaintance at all was one of the signs that had helped establish Milly as a young woman with a world of possibilities before her, someone to be admired and pitied. Alone, without a mother, unprotected, but with her other advantages—her large house, her great wealth, her freedom—she had recently begun "receiving," as older women did, like princesses who had public duties and matured very quickly. If Mrs. Stringham understood that Mr. Densher had left for another location for his work before her trip to New York, she also realized that he had returned for a day or two afterward—that is, after her second trip—and had, in short, reappeared only once on his way West: on his way from Washington, she believed, though she didn't see him when she met her friend to leave. She hadn't thought to overstate the situation before tonight, or thought she could. But tonight she realized there had been just enough in their relationship to invite, to encourage, the idea of something more.</i></p></div>

She presently put it that, at any rate, promise or
no promise, Milly would, at a pinch, be able, in
London, to act on his permission to make him a
sign; to which Milly replied with readiness that her
ability, though evident, would be none the less quite
wasted, inasmuch as the gentleman would, to a certainty,
be still in America. He had a great deal to
do there—which he would scarce have begun; and
in fact she might very well not have thought of
London at all if she hadn't been sure he wasn't yet
near coming back. It was perceptible to her companion
that the moment our young woman had so
far committed herself she had a sense of having
overstepped; which was not quite patched up by
her saying the next minute, possibly with a certain
failure of presence of mind, that the last thing she
desired was the air of running after him. Mrs.
Stringham wondered privately what question there
could be of any such appearance—the danger of
which thus suddenly came up; but she said, for the
time, nothing of it—she only said other things: one
of which was, for instance, that if Mr. Densher was
away he was away, and that this was the end of it;
also that of course they must be discreet at any
price. But what was the measure of discretion,
and how was one to be sure? So it was that, as
they sat there, she produced her own case: <i>she</i> had
a possible tie with London, which she desired as
little to disown as she might wish to risk presuming
on it. She treated her companion, in short, for
their evening's end, to the story of Maud Manningham,
the odd but interesting English girl who had
formed her special affinity in the old days at the
Vevey school; whom she had written to, after their
separation, with a regularity that had at first faltered
and then altogether failed, yet that had been for
the time quite a fine case of crude constancy; so
that it had in fact flickered up again of itself on the
occasion of the marriage of each. They had then
once more fondly, scrupulously written—Mrs.
Lowder first; and even another letter or two had
afterwards passed. This, however, had been the
end—though with no rupture, only a gentle drop:
Maud Manningham had made, she believed, a great
marriage, while she herself had made a small; on
top of which, moreover, distance, difference, diminished
community and impossible reunion had done
the rest of the work. It was but after all these years
that reunion had begun to show as possible—if the
other party to it, that is, should be still in existence.
That was exactly what it now struck our friend as
interesting to ascertain, as, with one aid and another,
she believed she might. It was an experiment
she would at all events now make if Milly
didn't object.
</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She then stated that, regardless of any promises, Milly could, if necessary, use his permission to signal him in London. Milly readily replied that, although she could do it, it wouldn't matter because he would definitely still be in America. He had a lot to do there, which he probably hadn't even started. In fact, she might not have even thought about London if she wasn't certain he wasn't coming back soon. Her friend noticed that as soon as Milly said this, she seemed to realize she'd said too much. Her next comment, maybe a little flustered, didn't really fix it: that the last thing she wanted was to seem like she was chasing after him. Mrs. Stringham privately wondered why there was any concern about appearing that way, but she said nothing about it then. She just said other things: for instance, that if Mr. Densher was away, he was away, and that was that. Also, that they of course had to be discreet. But how discreet was discreet, and how could they be sure? So, as they sat there, she told her own story: she had a possible connection to London that she didn't want to deny, but also didn't want to presume upon. She shared the story of Maud Manningham, the peculiar but interesting English girl who had been her close friend at school in Vevey. After they parted, she had written to her regularly, though it had eventually stopped, but it was a sign of real devotion at the time; in fact, the letters had started up again around each of their weddings. They had then written to each other again with affection and care—Mrs. Lowder first—and even sent a couple more letters after that. But then it ended, though not with a fight, just a gradual fade. Maud Manningham had, she thought, married into wealth, while she herself had married into less; and on top of that, distance, different lives, less in common, and no chance of getting back together had finished it off. But after all these years, a reunion seemed possible—if the other person, that is, was still alive. That was exactly what she now found interesting to find out, and she believed she could with some help. She was going to try it now, unless Milly objected.</i></p></div>

Milly in general objected to nothing, and, though
she asked a question or two, she raised no
present plea. Her questions—or at least her own
answers to them—kindled, on Mrs. Stringham's
part, a backward train: she hadn't known till tonight
how much she remembered, or how fine it
might be to see what had become of large, high-coloured
Maud, florid, exotic and alien—which had
been just the spell—even to the perceptions of
youth. There was the danger—she frankly touched
it—that such a temperament mightn't have matured,
with the years, all in the sense of fineness;
it was the sort of danger that, in renewing relations
after long breaks, one had always to look in the face.
To gather in strayed threads was to take a risk—for
which, however, she was prepared if Milly was.
The possible "fun," she confessed, was by itself
rather tempting; and she fairly sounded, with this—wound
up a little as she was—the note of fun as
the harmless final right of fifty years of mere New
England virtue. Among the things she was afterwards
to recall was the indescribable look dropped
on her, at this, by her companion; she was still
seated there between the candles and before the
finished supper, while Milly moved about, and the
look was long to figure for her as an inscrutable
comment on <i>her</i> notion of freedom. Challenged,
at any rate, as for the last wise word, Milly showed
perhaps, musingly, charmingly, that, though her
attention had been mainly soundless, her friend's
story—produced as a resource unsuspected, a card
from up the sleeve—half surprised, half beguiled
her. Since the matter, such as it was, depended on
that, she brought out, before she went to bed, an
easy, a light "Risk everything!"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly was generally agreeable and didn't object to anything, though she asked a few questions. She didn't voice any immediate concerns. Her questions – or at least her own answers – triggered a flood of memories in Mrs. Stringham. She hadn't realized until that evening how much she remembered, or how interesting it would be to see what had become of the vibrant, exotic, and different Maud. That difference had been part of her allure, even when they were young. There was a risk, she admitted frankly, that such a fiery personality might not have developed gracefully with age. It was a risk you had to face when reconnecting with someone after a long time apart. Reconnecting and gathering up old friendships always carried a chance of disappointment, but she was willing to take that chance if Milly was. The potential "fun," she confessed, was quite tempting in itself, and she almost reveled in this – fueled by a little excitement – as the harmless final reward of a lifetime of simple, moral living. One of the things she would later remember was the indescribable look Milly gave her at this moment. Mrs. Stringham was still sitting there between the candles, the supper finished, while Milly moved around. That look would linger in her memory as a mysterious comment on her idea of freedom. It was as if Milly was offering the final, wise word. Milly seemed to show, thoughtfully and charmingly, that although she'd been mostly quiet, her friend's story—presented as an unexpected option, a secret weapon—had partly surprised and partly charmed her. Since the whole thing depended on Milly's willingness, she said easily and lightly, before going to bed, "Risk everything!"</i></p></div>

This quality in it seemed possibly a little to deny
weight to Maud Lowder's evoked presence—as
Susan Stringham, still sitting up, became, in excited
reflection, a trifle more conscious. Something determinant,
when the girl had left her, took place in
her—nameless but, as soon as she had given way,
coercive. It was as if she knew again, in this fulness
of time, that she had been, after Maud's marriage,
just sensibly outlived or, as people nowadays
said, shunted. Mrs. Lowder had left her behind,
and on the occasion, subsequently, of the corresponding
date in her own life—not the second, the
sad one, with its dignity of sadness, but the first,
with the meagreness of its supposed felicity—she
had been, in the same spirit, almost patronisingly
pitied. If that suspicion, even when it had ceased
to matter, had never quite died out for her, there
was doubtless some oddity in its now offering itself
as a link, rather than as another break, in the chain;
and indeed there might well have been for her a
mood in which the notion of the development of
patronage in her quondam schoolmate would have
settled her question in another sense. It was actually
settled—if the case be worth our analysis—by
the happy consummation, the poetic justice, the
generous revenge, of her having at last something
to show. Maud, on their parting company, had
appeared to have so much, and would now—for
wasn't it also, in general, quite the rich law of English
life?—have, with accretions, promotions, expansions,
ever so much more. Very good; such
things might be; she rose to the sense of being
ready for them. Whatever Mrs. Lowder might
have to show—and one hoped one did the presumptions
all justice—she would have nothing like Milly
Theale, who constituted the trophy producible by
poor Susan. Poor Susan lingered late—till the
candles were low, and as soon as the table was
cleared she opened her neat portfolio. She had not
lost the old clue; there were connections she remembered,
addresses she could try; so the thing
was to begin. She wrote on the spot.

Something decisive, which she couldn't name, took hold of her as soon as the girl had left—but it was compelling. It was as if, now, at this moment, she understood again that after Maud's marriage, she had just been, in a sensible way, left behind, or, as people say today, sidelined. Mrs. Lowder had outpaced her, and on the occasion of the anniversary of her own life—not the second, sad one, with its dignified sadness, but the first, with its supposedly meager happiness—she had been, in a similar spirit, almost condescendingly pitied. Even though that feeling had faded, it had never completely vanished; and there was probably something strange in it now appearing as a connection, rather than another barrier, in their relationship. Indeed, she might well have been in a frame of mind where the idea of her former schoolmate gaining power would have answered her question in a different way. But the matter was actually settled—if it's worth our examining—by the joyful fulfillment, the poetic justice, the satisfying revenge, of having something to show for herself. Maud, when they had last met, seemed to have so much, and now—because wasn't it also, generally, the rich pattern of English life?—she would have, with added wealth, advancement, and influence, even more. Very well; those things might be; Susan felt ready to face them. Whatever Mrs. Lowder might have to show—and she hoped she was fairly assessing the situation—she wouldn't have anything like Milly Theale, who represented the achievement that poor Susan could now display.
