<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Kate accompanies Milly to a doctor's appointment. The doctor, Sir Luke Strett, has only ten minutes but schedules another appointment with Milly in a day or two. After the brief meeting, Milly tells Kate that the doctor is a "dear," that he will take care of her, and that she is to see him again. Milly decides to attend the next appointment by herself and asks Kate for her discretion. While waiting for their carriage, Milly reassures Kate that she is satisfied and feels "absolved."</p><p>Two days later, Milly goes to her second appointment alone. The doctor asks if she was accompanied. She explains that she is alone, with no living family members. After examining her, the doctor gives her a small prescription and says he will visit her at her home in a few days. He instructs her to leave London after his visit and says she can go to the continent. He says he will "follow you up." Before she leaves, Milly asks if she will suffer, and he answers, "Not a bit." When she asks if she will live, he replies that this is what he is trying to persuade her to do.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Milly is presented as a highly perceptive, romantic, and emotionally volatile young woman who is isolated and grappling with a serious, unnamed affliction. She interprets her experiences through a rich inner monologue, transforming a brief medical appointment into a profound, almost spiritual event. She feels she is "loosely rattling" through life and craves a sense of firmness and order, even if it comes from a grim diagnosis.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Milly enters the doctor's office anxious and overwhelmed. In ten minutes, her situation shifts dramatically: she feels an immediate, deep sense of trust and relief, as if she has been "absolved." She leaves the first meeting feeling she has gained an "absolute possession" in the form of the doctor's friendship. By the second meeting, this feeling solidifies into a paradoxical comfort; she accepts that his kindness implies her situation is "bad," yet finds a strange stability in being "found out" by his genius.</li>
<li>*Sir Luke Strett (The Doctor)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Sir Luke is portrayed through Milly’s eyes as a "great man" who is authoritative yet gentle. He projects an aura of profound, intuitive knowledge, seeming to understand Milly’s condition and character with minimal questioning ("He can tell. He knows"). He is described as looking like a "general" and a "bishop," combining firmness with a capacity for kindness that Milly finds comforting.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Initially presented as a busy professional with only ten minutes to spare, his role quickly shifts to that of a dedicated, almost paternalistic guide. He commits to seeing Milly again, visiting her, and even following her abroad, moving beyond a standard doctor-patient relationship into one of "unlimited interest."</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Kate is presented as a pragmatic and skeptical friend. Her concern is direct and physical, comparing Milly’s consultation to a tooth extraction ("Is it out?"). She presses for concrete facts ("what does he say?") and is suspicious of the doctor's rapid, intuitive assessment. Her friendship has a transactional quality; she demands "the truth" in exchange for her discretion.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Kate begins as Milly's close companion, accompanying her to the appointment. Her situation shifts when Milly decides to see the doctor alone the next time, effectively moving Kate from an active participant to an outsider who is now only granted information at Milly's discretion.</li></ul>

<p>
What it really came to, on the morrow, this first
time—the time Kate went with her—was that the
great man had, a little, to excuse himself; had, by a
rare accident—for he kept his consulting-hours in
general rigorously free—but ten minutes to give her;
ten mere minutes which he yet placed at her service
in a manner that she admired even more than she
could meet it: so crystal-clean the great empty cup
of attention that he set between them on the table.
He was presently to jump into his carriage, but he
promptly made the point that he must see her again,
see her within a day or two; and he named for her
at once another hour—easing her off beautifully too
even then in respect to her possibly failing of justice
to her errand. The minutes affected her in fact as
ebbing more swiftly than her little army of items
could muster, and they would probably have gone
without her doing much more than secure another
hearing, had it not been for her sense, at the last,
that she had gained above all an impression. The
impression—all the sharp growth of the final few
moments—was neither more nor less than that she
might make, of a sudden, in quite another world,
another straight friend, and a friend who would
moreover be, wonderfully, the most appointed, the
most thoroughly adjusted of the whole collection,
inasmuch as he would somehow wear the character
scientifically, ponderably, proveably—not just loosely
and sociably. Literally, furthermore, it wouldn't
really depend on herself, Sir Luke Strett's friendship,
in the least; perhaps what made her most stammer
and pant was its thus queerly coming over her
that she might find she had interested him even beyond
her intention, find she was in fact launched in
some current that would lose itself in the sea of science.
At the same time that she struggled, however,
she also surrendered; there was a moment at which
she almost dropped the form of stating, of explaining,
and threw herself, without violence, only with
a supreme pointless quaver that had turned, the next
instant, to an intensity of interrogative stillness,
upon his general goodwill. His large, settled face,
though firm, was not, as she had thought at first,
hard; he looked, in the oddest manner, to her fancy,
half like a general and half like a bishop, and she
was soon sure that, within some such handsome
range, what it would show her would be what was
good, what was best for her. She had established,
in other words, in this time-saving way, a relation
with it; and the relation was the special trophy that,
for the hour, she bore off. It was like an absolute
possession, a new resource altogether, something
done up in the softest silk and tucked away under
the arm of memory. She hadn't had it when she
went in, and she had it when she came out; she had
it there under her cloak, but dissimulated, invisibly
carried, when smiling, smiling, she again faced Kate
Croy. That young lady had of course awaited her
in another room, where, as the great man was to absent
himself, no one else was in attendance; and she
rose for her with such a face of sympathy as might
have graced the vestibule of a dentist. "Is it out?"
she seemed to ask as if it had been a question of a
tooth; and Milly indeed kept her in no suspense
at all.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Here’s what happened the next day, the first time Kate went with her. The important man had to apologize a little because, in a rare accident (he usually kept his appointment times strictly), he only had ten minutes to spare. He gave her those ten minutes, and she admired the way he did it. He gave her his complete, undivided attention, like a clear glass set between them. He was about to leave in his carriage, but he insisted on seeing her again within a day or two. He even immediately scheduled another meeting, subtly reassuring her that she wouldn't necessarily be able to fully explain everything in their short time. The minutes flew by faster than she could present her arguments, and she probably wouldn't have accomplished much beyond setting up another appointment, if she hadn’t gotten the strong feeling at the end that she had made an impression.</i></p><p><i>This impression, which really solidified in the last few moments, was simply that she might find a new, straightforward friend in a completely different world. Moreover, this friend would be the most suitable and well-suited of all her acquaintances, because he would understand his role scientifically, thoroughly, and demonstrably, not just casually and socially. Furthermore, her connection with Sir Luke Strett wouldn't really depend on her at all. Perhaps what made her the most nervous was the strange realization that she might have captured his interest beyond her intentions, that she was in fact being carried along in a current that would lead her to the sea of scientific research.</i></p><p><i>However, even as she struggled, she also gave in. There was a moment when she nearly stopped trying to explain herself and instead, without any force, but with a supreme, pointless trembling that instantly transformed into a deep, questioning stillness, she relied on his general kindness. His large, settled face, though strong, wasn’t, as she had first thought, harsh. To her, he looked strangely like a mix of a general and a bishop. She quickly realized that within that handsome range, he would show her what was good and what was best for her. In other words, in this quick meeting, she had established a connection with him, and that connection was the special prize she took away with her. It was like an absolute treasure, a new resource, something wrapped in the softest silk and stored away in her memory. She didn’t have it when she went in, but she had it when she came out. She carried it under her cloak, hidden but present, as she smiled and faced Kate Croy again.</i></p><p><i>Kate had, of course, been waiting for her in another room, where, because the important man was leaving, no one else was present. She rose to greet her with a sympathetic expression, like one you might see in a dentist’s waiting room. "Is it done?" she seemed to ask, as if it were a matter of a tooth. And Milly didn’t keep her waiting at all.</i></p></div>

It just pulled her friend up, for even while they
talked—at least it was one of the reasons—she stood
there suddenly, irrelevantly, in the light of her <i>other</i>
identity, the identity she would have for Mr. Densher.
This was always, from one instant to another,
an incalculable light, which, though it might go off
faster than it came on, necessarily disturbed. It
sprang, with a perversity all its own, from the fact
that, with the lapse of hours and days, the chances
themselves that made for his being named continued
so oddly to fail. There were twenty, there were
fifty, but none of them turned up. This, in particular,
was of course not a juncture at which the least
of them would naturally be present; but it would
make, none the less, Milly saw, another day practically
all stamped with avoidance. She saw in a
quick glimmer, and with it all Kate's unconsciousness;
and then she shook off the obsession. But it
had lasted long enough to qualify her response. No,
she had shown Kate how she trusted her; and that,
for loyalty, would somehow do. "Oh, dear thing,
now that the ice is broken I shan't trouble <i>you</i> again."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It just brought her friend down because, even while they were talking—or at least that was one of the reasons—Milly suddenly stood there, unexpectedly, illuminated by her other self, the self she presented to Mr. Densher. This was always a difficult and unpredictable feeling, which, even though it could disappear quickly, was unsettling. It arose, with its own strange logic, from the fact that as time went on, the possibilities that might have led to him being mentioned continued to disappear. There were twenty possibilities, then fifty, but none of them materialized. Of course, this wasn't an occasion when any of them would normally appear, but it made, Milly realized, another day essentially marked by avoiding the topic. She understood this in a flash, along with Kate's unawareness, and then she pushed the thought away. But it had lasted long enough to change her reaction. Yes, she had shown Kate how much she trusted her, and that, as a sign of loyalty, would be enough. "Oh, darling, now that we've talked about it, I won't bother you about it anymore."</i></p></div>

Outside, before the door, on the wide pavement
of the great square, they had to wait again while
their carriage, which Milly had kept, completed a
further turn of exercise, engaged in by the coachman
for reasons of his own. The footman was there,
and had indicated that he was making the circuit;

Milly met her look now without a thought of anything
but the spoken. She had ceased to be Mr.
Densher's image; she was all her own memento
and she was none the less fine. Still, still, what had
passed was a fair bargain, and it would do. "Of
course I like it. I feel—I can't otherwise describe
it—as if I had been, on my knees, to the priest. I've
confessed and I've been absolved. It has been lifted

"Oh—doctors!" Milly said. "But I hope," she
added, "he didn't like me too much." Then as if
to escape a little from her friend's deeper sounding,
or as impatient for the carriage, not yet in sight, her
eyes, turning away, took in the great stale square.
As its staleness, however, was but that of London
fairly fatigued, the late hot London with its dance
all danced and its story all told, the air seemed a
thing of blurred pictures and mixed echoes, and an
impression met the sense—an impression that broke,
the next moment, through the girl's tightened lips.
"Oh, it's a beautiful big world, and everyone, yes,
everyone——!" It presently brought her back to
Kate, and she hoped she didn't actually look as much
as if she were crying as she must have looked to
Lord Mark among the portraits at Matcham.

The weariness of the square was just the typical tiredness of London, London worn out from the recent heat, the parties over, the stories all told. The air felt like a blur of images and a mixture of sounds. A feeling struck her—a feeling that then burst through the girl's tense lips.

She was to have found this preference, two days
later, abundantly justified; and yet when, in prompt
accordance with what had passed between them, she
reappeared before her distinguished friend—that
character having, for him, in the interval, built itself
up still higher—the first thing he asked her was
whether she had been accompanied. She told him,
on this, straightway, everything; completely free at
present from her first embarrassment, disposed even—as
she felt she might become—to undue volubility,
and conscious moreover of no alarm from his thus
perhaps wishing that she had not come alone. It
was exactly as if, in the forty-eight hours that had
passed, her acquaintance with him had somehow increased,
and his own knowledge in particular received
mysterious additions. They had been together,
before, scarce ten minutes; but the relation,
the one the ten minutes had so beautifully created,
was there to take straight up: and this not, on his
own part, from mere professional heartiness, mere
bedside manner, which she would have disliked—much
rather from a quiet, pleasant air in him of having
positively asked about her, asked here and there
and found out. Of course he couldn't in the least
have asked, or have wanted to; there was no source
of information to his hand, and he had really needed
none: he had found out simply by his genius—and
found out, she meant, literally everything. Now
she knew not only that she didn't dislike this—the
state of being found out about; but that, on the contrary,
it was truly what she had come for, and that,
for the time at least, it would give her something firm
to stand on. She struck herself as aware, aware as
she had never been, of really not having had from
the beginning anything firm. It would be strange
for the firmness to come, after all, from her learning
in these agreeable conditions that she was in some
way doomed; but above all it would prove how little
she had hitherto had to hold her up. If she was now
to be held up by the mere process—since that was
perhaps on the cards—of being let down, this would
only testify in turn to her queer little history. <i>That</i>
sense of loosely rattling had been no process at all;
and it was ridiculously true that her thus sitting there
to see her life put into the scales represented her first
approach to the taste of orderly living. Such was
Milly's romantic version—that her life, especially by
the fact of this second interview, <i>was</i> put into the
scales; and just the best part of the relation established
might have been, for that matter, that the
great grave charming man knew, had known at once,
that it was romantic, and in that measure allowed
for it. Her only doubt, her only fear, was whether
he perhaps wouldn't even take advantage of her being
a little romantic to treat her as romantic altogether.
This doubtless was her danger with him;
but she should see, and dangers in general meanwhile
dropped and dropped.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Two days later, she would find her choice completely validated. When she went back to see her distinguished friend—a man whose reputation had grown in the meantime—right away he asked her if she had come with anyone. She immediately told him everything, now completely over her initial awkwardness, even possibly inclined to talk too much, and not at all worried that he seemed to wish she hadn't come alone. It was as if their acquaintance had deepened in those two days, and as if he had gained some mysterious knowledge about her. They had only spent ten minutes together before, but the connection they'd formed was still strong. He wasn't just being friendly in a professional way, like a doctor with a good bedside manner, which she wouldn't have liked. Instead, he seemed genuinely interested in her, as if he'd asked around about her and found things out. Of course, he couldn't have actually asked anyone, and he didn't need to. He just knew, simply by his intuition—and by "knew," she meant literally everything. Now, she realized that she didn't mind being "found out." On the contrary, that's what she had come for, and it would give her something stable to rely on, at least for a while. She realized she had never actually had anything stable to begin with. It would be strange if this stability came from discovering that she was in some way doomed, but it would also show how little she had had to support her until now. If she were now to be supported by the very process of being brought down—since that was possibly the plan—it would just confirm her unusual past. That feeling of being adrift had been no support at all. It was ridiculous, but true, that sitting there, having her life assessed, was her first experience of a structured life. That was Milly's romantic idea: that her life was being weighed in the balance, especially because of this second meeting. The best part of their relationship might be that the great, serious, charming man knew, from the start, that it was romantic, and was taking that into account. Her only doubt, her only fear, was that he might take advantage of her being a little romantic, and treat her as a completely romantic person. That was probably her danger with him, but she'd see, and for the moment, any other concerns fell away.</i></p></div>

The very place, at the end of a few minutes, the
commodious, "handsome" room, far back in the fine
old house, soundless from position, somewhat sallow
with years of celebrity, somewhat sombre even at
midsummer—the very place put on for her a look of
custom and use, squared itself solidly round her as
with promises and certainties. She had come forth
to see the world, and this then was to be the world's
light, the rich dusk of a London "back," these the
world's walls, those the world's curtains and carpet.
She should be intimate with the great bronze clock
and mantel-ornaments, conspicuously presented in
gratitude and long ago; she should be as one of the
circle of eminent contemporaries, photographed,
engraved, signatured, and in particular framed and
glazed, who made up the rest of the decoration, and
made up as well so much of the human comfort; and
while she thought of all the clean truths, unfringed,
unfingered, that the listening stillness, strained into
pauses and waits, would again and again, for years,
have kept distinct, she also wondered what she would
eventually decide upon to present in gratitude. She
would give something better at least than the brawny
Victorian bronzes. This was precisely an instance
of what she felt he knew of her before he had done
with her: that she was secretly romancing at that
rate, in the midst of so much else that was more
urgent, all over the place. So much for her secrets
with him, none of which really required to be
phrased. It would have been, for example, a secret
for her from any one else that without a dear lady
she had picked up just before coming over she
wouldn't have a decently near connection, of any
sort, for such an appeal as she was making, to put
forward: no one in the least, as it were, to produce
for respectability. But <i>his</i> seeing it she didn't mind a
scrap, and not a scrap either his knowing how she
had left the dear lady in the dark. She had come
alone, putting her friend off with a fraud: giving
a pretext of shops, of a whim, of she didn't know
what—the amusement of being for once in the
streets by herself. The streets by herself were new
to her—she had always had in them a companion, or
a maid; and he was never to believe, moreover, that
she couldn't take full in the face anything he might
have to say. He was softly amused at her account
of her courage; though he yet showed it somehow
without soothing her too grossly. Still, he did want
to know whom she had. Hadn't there been a lady
with her on Wednesday?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Within minutes, this comfortable, "handsome" room, located at the back of the elegant old house, silent due to its position, a bit faded from years of being famous, and even somewhat gloomy in the middle of summer—this very room embraced her, familiar and welcoming, enclosing her with a sense of security and certainty. She had come to experience the world, and this, then, was to be the world's ambiance, the rich twilight of a London "back room," these the world's walls, those the world's curtains and carpet. She would become accustomed to the large bronze clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, prominently displayed as gifts from long ago. She would become a part of the circle of famous contemporaries, immortalized in photographs, engravings, signatures, and framed pictures, which made up the rest of the decor and provided so much of the room's comfort. And as she considered all the simple, untouched truths that the listening silence, stretched into pauses and expectations, would preserve for years to come, she also wondered what she would eventually offer in return, what she would give as her gift of gratitude. It would be something better than those bulky Victorian bronzes, at least. This was exactly the kind of thing he knew about her before he even spoke: that she was secretly indulging in fantasies, even amidst more pressing matters, a habit she embraced everywhere she went. So much for her secrets with him, none of which needed to be spoken. For example, it would have been a secret from anyone else that without a dear friend she’d met just before coming, she wouldn't have had a connection, no matter how tenuous, to help her make the request she was about to make. She had no one, so to speak, to present for appearances' sake. But he knew it, and she didn’t mind at all. She didn’t mind either that he knew she’d left the dear lady in the dark. She had come alone, using a lie to get rid of her friend: inventing a reason about shopping, a whim, or something—the fun of being in the streets by herself for once. Being alone in the streets was new to her; she had always had a companion or a maid. Furthermore, he was never to believe that she couldn't handle whatever he might have to say. He was subtly amused by her account of her bravery, though he somehow showed it without patronizing her. Still, he did want to know who she had with her.

It didn't take much computation, but she nevertheless
had to think a moment, conscious as she was
that he distinctly <i>would</i> want to fill out his notion
of her—even a little, as it were, to warm the air for
her. That, however—and better early than late—he
must accept as of no use; and she herself felt for
an instant quite a competent certainty on the subject
of any such warming. The air, for Milly Theale,
was, from the very nature of the case, destined never
to rid itself of a considerable chill. This she could
tell him with authority, if she could tell him nothing
else; and she seemed to see now, in short, that it
would importantly simplify. "Yes, it makes another;
but they all together wouldn't make—well,
I don't know what to call it but the difference. I
mean when one is—really alone. I've never seen
anything like the kindness." She pulled up a minute
while he waited—waited again as if with his reasons
for letting her, for almost making her, talk. What
she herself wanted was not, for the third time, to
cry, as it were, in public. She <i>had</i> never seen anything
like the kindness, and she wished to do it justice;
but she knew what she was about, and justice
was not wronged by her being able presently to stick
to her point. "Only one's situation is what it is.
It's me it concerns. The rest is delightful and useless.
Nobody can really help. That's why I'm by
myself to-day. I <i>want</i> to be—in spite of Miss Croy,
who came with me last. If you can help, so much
the better and also of course if one can, a little,
one's self. Except for that—you and me doing our
best—I like you to see me just as I am. Yes, I like
it—and I don't exaggerate. Shouldn't one, at the
start, show the worst—so that anything after that
may be better? It wouldn't make any real difference—it
<i>won't</i> make any, anything that may happen
won't—to any one. Therefore I feel myself, this
way, with you, just as I am; and—if you do in the
least care to know—it quite positively bears me up."
She put it as to his caring to know, because his
manner seemed to give her all her chance, and the
impression was there for her to take. It was strange
and deep for her, this impression, and she did, accordingly,
take it straight home. It showed him—showed
him in spite of himself—as allowing, somewhere
far within, things comparatively remote,
things in fact quite, as she would have said, outside,
delicately to weigh with him; showed him as interested,
on her behalf, in other questions beside the
question of what was the matter with her. She accepted
such an interest as regular in the highest type
of scientific mind—his <i>being</i> the even highest, magnificently
because otherwise, obviously, it wouldn't
be there; but she could at the same time take it as
a direct source of light upon herself, even though
that might present her a little as pretending to equal
him. Wanting to know more about a patient than
how a patient was constructed or deranged couldn't
be, even on the part of the greatest of doctors, anything
but some form or other of the desire to let
the patient down easily. When that was the case
the reason, in turn, could only be, too manifestly,
pity; and when pity held up its tell-tale face like
a head on a pike, in a French revolution, bobbing
before a window, what was the inference but that
the patient was bad? He might say what he would
now—she would always have seen the head at the
window; and in fact from this moment she only
wanted him to say what he would. He might say
it too with the greater ease to himself as there wasn't
one of her divinations that—as her own—he would
in any way put himself out for. Finally, if he was
making her talk she <i>was</i> talking; and what it could,
at any rate, come to for him was that she wasn't
afraid. If he wanted to do the dearest thing in the
world for her he would show her he believed she
wasn't; which undertaking of hers—not to have
misled him—was what she counted at the moment
as her presumptuous little hint to him that she was
as good as himself. It put forward the bold idea
that he could really <i>be</i> misled; and there actually
passed between them for some seconds a sign, a sign
of the eyes only, that they knew together where they
were. This made, in their brown old temple of
truth, its momentary flicker; then what followed it
was that he had her, all the same, in his pocket; and
the whole thing wound up, for that consummation,
with its kind dim smile. Such kindness was wonderful
with such dimness; but brightness—that even
of sharp steel—was of course for the other side of
the business, and it would all come in for her in
one way or another. "Do you mean," he asked,
"that you've no relations at all?—not a parent, not
a sister, not even a cousin nor an aunt?"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She didn't need to think hard, but she still had to pause for a moment. She knew he wanted to understand her better, even to try and make her feel more comfortable. But she knew that was pointless. She had to accept that he couldn't help her, and it was better to face it now. She felt a certain certainty about her situation. For Milly Theale, the situation was such that she would always feel a deep chill. She could tell him this, if nothing else. And she realized it would simplify things. "Yes, it creates another problem," she said. "But all those problems together don't equal... I don't know what to call it, but it's the difference. I mean when someone is truly alone. I've never experienced anything like the kindness I've received." She stopped for a moment while he waited—he seemed to be giving her space to talk. She didn't want to break down in front of him again. She'd never known such kindness, and she wanted to acknowledge it, but she knew what she was doing, and acknowledging it didn't mean she couldn't stick to the point. "My situation is what it is. It concerns me. Everything else is wonderful, but doesn't change anything. No one can truly help. That's why I'm here alone today. I want to be—despite Miss Croy being with me last time. If you can help, great, and if I can help myself a little, even better. But beyond that—just you and me doing our best—I want you to see me as I am. Yes, I like it—and I'm not exaggerating. Shouldn't you start by showing the worst—so that anything after that might be better? It won't make a difference, anything that may happen won't affect anyone. So, I feel comfortable being myself with you. And—if you care—it really helps me."</i></p><p><i>She phrased it this way because he seemed to be giving her the opportunity, and she sensed that he was listening. It was a strange and profound impression, and she took it to heart. He was allowing, deep down, for things she considered remote, things that were, in fact, outside of her situation, to influence him. He was interested, on her behalf, in things beyond her illness. She considered such interest normal for the most brilliant scientific minds—his being the most brilliant because, if it weren't, it wouldn't be there. At the same time, she could see this as shedding light on herself, even if it made her appear to be trying to equal him. Wanting to know more about a patient than just how their body or mind functions could only be, even for the greatest doctor, a way of softening the blow for the patient. In that case, the reason, too obvious, was pity. When pity showed itself, like a head on a stake from a French revolution, bobbing in the window, what could she conclude but that she was in a bad way? He could say whatever he wanted now—she would always see the head in the window. From this moment on, she just wanted him to say what he thought. He could speak freely because he wouldn't be trying to help her in any way. She was talking because he was making her talk. The main thing for him was that she wasn't afraid. If he wanted to do the best thing for her, he would show her he believed she wasn't. Her intention not to mislead him was her way of hinting to him that she was as capable as he was. It suggested he could be wrong, and for a few seconds they exchanged a look that showed they understood each other. This created a moment of truth, then it was clear that she was essentially trapped in his process. It all ended with his kind, gentle smile. That kindness was wonderful, but the harsh truth was for the other side of this situation, and it would all come into play for her eventually.

spontaneity in a manner to show that he had often
had it from young persons of her race, and that he
was familiar even with the possibilities of their
familiarity, she felt her freedom rendered vain by
his silence, and she immediately tried to think of the
most reasonable thing she could say. This would
be, precisely, on the subject of that freedom, which
she now quickly spoke of as complete. "That's of
course by itself a great boon; so please don't think

understood him the next moment as having thus
taken it from her that her means were as great as
might be. She had simply given it to him so, and
this was all that would ever pass between them on

that an important effect, for his judgment, or
at least for his amusement—which was his feeling,
since, marvellously, he did have feeling—was produced
by it. All her little pieces had now then fallen
together for him like the morsels of coloured glass

"You'll <i>do</i> anything under the sun? Good." He
took that beautifully, ever so pleasantly, for what it
was worth; but time was needed—ten minutes or
so were needed on the spot—to deal even provisionally,
with the substantive question. It was convenient,
in its degree, that there was nothing she
wouldn't do; but it seemed also highly and agreeably
vague that she should have to do anything. They
thus appeared to be taking her, together, for the moment,
and almost for sociability, as prepared to proceed
to gratuitous extremities; the upshot of which
was in turn, that after much interrogation, auscultation,
exploration, much noting of his own sequences
and neglecting of hers, had duly kept up the vagueness,
they might have struck themselves, or may at
least strike us, as coming back from an undeterred
but useless voyage to the north pole. Milly was
ready, under orders, for the north pole; which fact
was doubtless what made a blinding anticlimax of her
friend's actual abstention from orders. "No," she
