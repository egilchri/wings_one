<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>For a week following a dinner, an American pair, Milly Theale and her companion Mrs. Stringham (Susan Shepherd), are in London. Milly and Mrs. Stringham frequently remark to each other that they have only themselves to thank. Mrs. Stringham is pleased because an appeal she made to her old schoolmate, Mrs. Lowder (Maud Manningham), was met positively.</p><p>During this week, the two elder women, Mrs. Stringham and Mrs. Lowder, spend time together. Mrs. Stringham tells Mrs. Lowder about Milly, and Mrs. Lowder tells Mrs. Stringham about her niece, Kate Croy.</p><p>At the same time, Milly and Kate Croy become friends and spend their days together. They explore London's shops, streets, suburbs, museums, and monuments. Milly gives Mrs. Stringham accounts of her time with Kate. She tells Mrs. Stringham she thinks Kate has a secret trouble and is using their friendship as a diversion.</p><p>Kate tells Milly about her family situation. In turn, Milly tells Kate about her American background, her family's financial history, and her deceased relatives. Each tells the other she finds her more remarkable than herself.</p><p>During their outings, Milly gives Kate several presents, including precious ornaments. Kate tells Milly she must avoid shops unless Milly promises not to buy things for her.</p><p>By the end of the week, Milly asks Kate for information about Lord Mark and to be promised a visit to Kate's sister, Mrs. Condrip. Kate explains that Lord Mark's value is based on his future potential, which her aunt believes in. She says he was briefly in Parliament but lost his seat. Kate also explains to Milly that in London society, relationships are like bargains where everyone gives something to get something in return. She says that both she and Milly have been "taken up" by Mrs. Lowder.</p><p>In another conversation, Milly observes to Kate that she is surprised Mrs. Lowder is not bored by Mrs. Stringham. Kate agrees, and Milly sees that Kate finds Mrs. Stringham uninteresting.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** An immensely wealthy, curious, and imaginative American, Milly is initially presented as a "slightly gasping" newcomer, likened to a "wandering princess." She perceives the world through a romantic and literary lens, immediately casting Kate as a "heroine." She is perceptive, guessing Kate has a secret trouble, yet naive about social dangers. She is extremely generous and possesses a freedom from financial anxiety that Kate finds remarkable.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** She moves from being a passive observer "caught up by a wave" to an active and engaged participant in London life. Her initial awe shifts to a deep fascination, and she quickly forms an intense friendship with Kate, even beginning to see her own powerful status through Kate’s eyes.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Stringham (Susan "Susie" Shepherd)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Milly’s older companion, a "pilgrim from Boston." She is analytical and values understanding the reasons behind actions. She is initially in a state of "exaltation" that her social faith in Mrs. Lowder has been justified. This gives way to a feeling of being "carried away" by the "vast, obscure, lurid" London world, which gives her a "bad conscience."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts from one of simple, triumphant success to a more complex state of being both fascinated and morally unnerved by her new environment. She is simultaneously thrilled for Milly and overwhelmed herself.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** A "handsome English girl," she is presented as pragmatic, worldly, and observant. Milly sees her as the archetype of the "wondrous London girl," but Kate sees herself as part of a transactional social system where people are either "working" or "being worked." She has an unspoken "smothered trouble." She is described as having a defensive "brutality" and a quickness to judge what she will not like.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Initially positioned as a guide for Milly, Kate quickly becomes an intimate friend and a powerful influence. She shifts from being an object of Milly’s romantic imagination to an active force who provides a cynical but frank education in the ways of her world.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Maud Manningham)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** A formidable and powerful London hostess. She is described as "large" not because she is empty but because she is "full," like a "projectile... loaded and ready for use." She is a woman of action who operates on instinct rather than articulated reasons. She is a social force who "takes people up" and in whom others, like Kate, place their belief.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her primary shift occurred just before this text begins by unexpectedly and graciously welcoming her old American friends. Within the passage, she is a stable center of power, actively managing her social circle and setting events in motion for the other characters.</li></ul>

That sense of quantities, separate or mixed, was
indeed doubtless what most prevailed at first for our
slightly gasping American pair; it found utterance
for them in their frequent remark to each other that
they had no one but themselves to thank. It dropped
from Milly more than once that if she had ever
known it was so easy—! though her exclamation
mostly ended without completing her idea. This,
however, was a trifle to Mrs. Stringham, who cared
little whether she meant that in this case she would
have come sooner. She couldn't have come sooner,
and she perhaps, on the contrary, meant—for it
would have been like her—that she wouldn't have
come at all; why it was so easy being at any rate
a matter as to which her companion had begun
quickly to pick up views. Susie kept some of these
lights for the present to herself, since, freely communicated,
they might have been a little disturbing;
with which, moreover, the quantities that we speak
of as surrounding the two ladies were, in many cases,
quantities of things—and of other things—to talk
about. Their immediate lesson, accordingly, was
that they just had been caught up by the incalculable
strength of a wave that was actually holding them
aloft and that would naturally dash them wherever
it liked. They meanwhile, we hasten to add, make
the best of their precarious position, and if Milly had
had no other help for it she would have found not
a little in the sight of Susan Shepherd's state. The
girl had had nothing to say to her, for three days,
about the "success" announced by Lord Mark—which
they saw, besides, otherwise established; she
was too taken up, too touched, by Susie's own exaltation.
Susie glowed in the light of her justified
faith; everything had happened that she had been
acute enough to think least probable; she had appealed
to a possible delicacy in Maud Manningham—a
delicacy, mind you, but <i>barely</i> possible—and her
appeal had been met in a way that was an honour to
human nature. This proved sensibility of the lady
of Lancaster Gate performed verily, for both our
friends, during these first days, the office of a fine
floating gold-dust, something that threw over the
prospect a harmonising blur. The forms, the colours
behind it were strong and deep—we have seen how
they already stood out for Milly; but nothing, comparatively,
had had so much of the dignity of truth
as the fact of Maud's fidelity to a sentiment. That
was what Susie was proud of, much more than of
her great place in the world, which she was moreover
conscious of not as yet wholly measuring. That
was what was more vivid even than her being—in
senses more worldly and in fact almost in the degree
of a revelation—English and distinct and positive,
with almost no inward, but with the finest outward
resonance.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The understanding of quantities, whether separate or combined, was undoubtedly the initial focus for our slightly bewildered American pair. They frequently remarked to each other that they were entirely responsible for their situation. Milly often mentioned that if she'd known it would be this easy—! though she rarely finished the thought. However, this didn't bother Mrs. Stringham, who didn't care whether Milly meant she would have come sooner. She couldn't have come sooner, and perhaps, on the contrary, she meant—as was typical of her—that she wouldn't have come at all. The ease of the situation was a concept Milly was quickly grasping. Susie kept some of her insights to herself for the time being, as sharing them freely might have been unsettling. Besides, the "quantities" surrounding the two women were, in many cases, things—and other things—to discuss. Their immediate lesson was that they'd been swept up by the overwhelming power of a wave, which was lifting them up and would naturally carry them wherever it chose. Meanwhile, they made the best of their precarious situation, and if Milly had nothing else to rely on, she would have found solace in observing Susan Shepherd's state. Susie hadn't mentioned Lord Mark's announced "success" for three days—which they also knew had been accomplished in other ways. She was too preoccupied and moved by Susie's own elation. Susie radiated with the joy of her confirmed beliefs; everything had happened that she'd thought least likely. She'd appealed to a possible sense of decency in Maud Manningham—a barely possible decency, mind you—and her appeal had been answered in a way that honored human nature. This demonstrated sensitivity from the woman of Lancaster Gate acted, for both friends, like a fine, floating gold dust during those first few days, softening the overall view with a harmonious blur. The shapes and colors behind it were strong and deep—as we've seen they already were for Milly; but nothing, in comparison, possessed as much the dignity of truth as Maud's loyalty to a feeling. That was what Susie was proud of, more than her high social standing, which she was still getting used to. That was more vivid even than her being—in a more worldly sense and to a degree that felt almost like a revelation—English and distinct and confident, with little introspection but the finest outward charm.</i></p></div>

<p>
Susan Shepherd's word for her, again and again,
was that she was "large"; yet it was not exactly a
case, as to the soul, of echoing chambers: she might
have been likened rather to a capacious receptacle,
originally perhaps loose, but now drawn as tightly
as possible over its accumulated contents—a packed
mass, for her American admirer, of curious detail.
When the latter good lady, at home, had handsomely
figured her friends as not small—which was the way
she mostly figured them—there was a certain implication
that they were spacious because they were
empty. Mrs. Lowder, by a different law, was spacious
because she was full, because she had something
in common, even in repose, with a projectile,
of great size, loaded and ready for use. That indeed,
to Susie's romantic mind, announced itself as
half the charm of their renewal—a charm as of sitting
in springtime, during a long peace, on the
daisied, grassy bank of some great slumbering fortress.
True to her psychological instincts, certainly,
Mrs. Stringham had noted that the "sentiment"
she rejoiced in on her old schoolmate's part was all
a matter of action and movement, was not, save for
the interweaving of a more frequent plump "dearest"
than she would herself perhaps have used, a
matter of much other embroidery. She brooded,
with interest, on this further remark of race, feeling
in her own spirit a different economy. The joy, for
her, was to know <i>why</i> she acted—the reason was
half the business; whereas with Mrs. Lowder there
might have been no reason: "why" was the trivial
seasoning-substance, the vanilla or the nutmeg, omittable
from the nutritive pudding without spoiling it.
Mrs. Lowder's desire was clearly sharp that their
young companions should also prosper together;
and Mrs. Stringham's account of it all to Milly, during
the first days, was that when, at Lancaster Gate,
she was not occupied in telling, as it were, about her,
she was occupied in hearing much of the history of
her hostess's brilliant niece.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Susan Shepherd repeatedly described her as "large," but it wasn't like she had an empty, echoing personality. She was more like a huge container. It might have been initially loose, but now it was tightly packed with everything she'd accumulated—a dense collection of interesting details for her American admirer. When that nice American woman would describe her friends as "not small" (which was her usual way of putting it), she implied they were spacious because they were empty. Mrs. Lowder, however, was spacious because she was full. She had something inside, even when she was still, like a massive, loaded projectile, ready to be launched. To Susie, this was half the appeal of their renewed connection—it was like sitting peacefully on a grassy bank covered in daisies during springtime, next to a huge, sleeping fortress.</i></p><p><i>Following her instincts, Mrs. Stringham had noticed that the "affection" her old friend felt was expressed through action and behavior. It wasn't about flowery language, except for the frequent use of "dearest," a term she herself wouldn't use as often. She thought about this difference with interest, because her own personality worked differently. For her, the joy was in understanding her own motives—the reasons behind her actions were essential. But with Mrs. Lowder, there might be no reason at all: the "why" was just a trivial detail, like vanilla or nutmeg, that could be left out of a nourishing pudding without changing it.</i></p><p><i>Mrs. Lowder clearly wanted their young friends to succeed together.

They had plenty, on these lines, the two elder
women, to give and to take, and it was even not quite
clear to the pilgrim from Boston that what she
should mainly have arranged for in London was not
a series of thrills for herself. She had a bad conscience,
indeed almost a sense of immorality, in having
to recognise that she was, as she said, carried
away. She laughed to Milly when she also said that
she didn't know where it would end; and the principal
of her uneasiness was that Mrs. Lowder's life
bristled for her with elements that she was really
having to look at for the first time. They represented,
she believed, the world, the world that, as a consequence
of the cold shoulder turned to it by the
Pilgrim Fathers, had never yet boldly crossed to Boston—it
would surely have sunk the stoutest Cunarder—and
she couldn't pretend that she faced the
prospect simply because Milly had had a caprice.
She was in the act herself of having one, directed
precisely to their present spectacle. She could but
seek strength in the thought that she had never had
one—or had never yielded to one, which came to the
same thing—before. The sustaining sense of it all,
moreover, as literary material—that quite dropped
from her. She must wait, at any rate, she should
see: it struck her, so far as she had got, as vast, obscure,
lurid. She reflected in the watches of the
night that she was probably just going to love it for
itself—that is for itself and Milly. The odd thing
was that she could think of Milly's loving it without
dread—or with dread, at least not on the score of
conscience, only on the score of peace. It was a
mercy, at all events, for the hour, that their fancies
jumped together.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The two older women had lots to talk about and discuss, and the visitor from Boston wasn't even sure that the main thing she should have been doing in London wasn't just chasing exciting experiences for herself. She felt guilty, almost like she was doing something wrong, admitting that she was, as she put it, getting swept away. She laughed to Milly when she also said she didn't know where it would lead. Her main worry was that Mrs. Lowder's life was filled with things she was really seeing for the first time. She thought these things represented the world, the world that, because the Pilgrim Fathers had rejected it, had never boldly gone to Boston—it would probably sink the biggest ship—and she couldn't pretend that she was facing this situation just because Milly had a whim. She was having a whim of her own, specifically directed at what they were experiencing. She could only find comfort in the idea that she had never had a whim—or had never given in to one, which amounted to the same thing—before. The idea that all this could be used as material for writing—that completely disappeared. She had to wait, anyway, and she would see: it seemed to her, at this stage, vast, unclear, and shocking. She realized during the night that she was probably going to love it just for what it was—that is, for itself and for Milly. The strange thing was that she could imagine Milly loving it without fear—or with fear, but not because she felt guilty, only because she worried about their peace of mind. It was a good thing, for now at least, that their imaginations were running in the same direction.</i></p></div>

While, for this first week that followed their dinner,
she drank deep at Lancaster Gate, her companion
was no less happily, appeared to be indeed on the
whole quite as romantically, provided for. The
handsome English girl from the heavy English house
had been as a figure in a picture stepping by magic
out of its frame: it was a case, in truth, for which
Mrs. Stringham presently found the perfect image.
She had lost none of her grasp, but quite the contrary,
of that other conceit in virtue of which Milly
was the wandering princess: so what could be more
in harmony now than to see the princess waited upon
at the city gate by the worthiest maiden, the chosen
daughter of the burgesses? It was the real again,
evidently, the amusement of the meeting for the
princess too; princesses living for the most part, in
such an appeased way, on the plane of mere elegant
representation. That was why they pounced, at city
gates, on deputed flower-strewing damsels; that was
why, after effigies, processions, and other stately
games, frank human company was pleasant to them.
Kate Croy really presented herself to Milly—the latter
abounded for Mrs. Stringham in accounts of it—as
the wondrous London girl in person, by what
she had conceived, from far back, of the London
girl; conceived from the tales of travellers and the
anecdotes of New York, from old porings over
<i>Punch</i> and a liberal acquaintance with the fiction of
the day. The only thing was that she was nicer,
for the creature in question had rather been, to our
young woman, an image of dread. She had thought
of her, at her best, as handsome just as Kate was,
with turns of head and tones of voice, felicities of
stature and attitude, things "put on" and, for that
matter, put off, all the marks of the product of a
packed society who should be at the same time the
heroine of a strong story. She placed this striking
young person from the first in a story, saw her, by a
necessity of the imagination, for a heroine, felt it the
only character in which she wouldn't be wasted; and
this in spite of the heroine's pleasant abruptness, her
forbearance from gush, her umbrellas and jackets
and shoes—as these things sketched themselves to
Milly—and something rather of a breezy boy in the
carriage of her arms and the occasional freedom of
her slang.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>For the week after their dinner, while Milly was enjoying herself at Lancaster Gate, her friend seemed equally happy, maybe even more romantically content. The beautiful English woman from the wealthy English family was like a character stepping out of a painting; Mrs. Stringham found the perfect metaphor for it. Milly still held onto the idea of being a wandering princess, so it was fitting to see her met at the city gate by the most deserving woman, the chosen daughter of the townspeople. It was reality again, obviously, and amusing for the princess as well, since princesses usually lived in a world of formal appearances. That’s why they loved meeting the flower-bearing girls at city gates, and why they enjoyed genuine company after the ceremonies and displays.</i></p><p><i>Kate Croy genuinely came across to Milly—as Mrs. Stringham heard repeatedly—as the amazing "London girl" in the flesh, a person based on what Milly had imagined from her early days: the London girl she’d read about in travelers’ stories and New York anecdotes, from old issues of Punch magazine, and a good understanding of contemporary fiction. The only difference was that Kate was even nicer. Milly had previously pictured her as intimidating, at best, beautiful like Kate, with a similar way of turning her head and speaking, a similar posture, a look that was both deliberate and easily discarded; all the hallmarks of a product of high society who should be the heroine of a powerful story. Milly immediately saw this striking young woman as a character in a story, a heroine by necessity, the only role where she wouldn’t be wasted. This was despite the heroine's friendly directness, her lack of emotional outbursts, and the practical clothes she wore—umbrellas, jackets, shoes—as Milly imagined them, and the slightly tomboyish way she carried herself and the occasional use of slang.</i></p></div>

When Milly had settled that the extent of her
goodwill itself made her shy, she had found for the
moment quite a sufficient key, and they were by that
time thoroughly afloat together. This might well
have been the happiest hour they were to know, attacking
in friendly independence their great London—the
London of shops and streets and suburbs oddly
interesting to Milly, as well as of museums, monuments,
"sights" oddly unfamiliar to Kate, while
their elders pursued a separate course, both rejoicing
in their intimacy and each thinking the other's young
woman a great acquisition for her own. Milly expressed
to Susan Shepherd more than once that Kate
had some secret, some smothered trouble, besides all
the rest of her history; and that if she had so good-naturedly
helped Mrs. Lowder to meet them this was
exactly to create a diversion, to give herself something
else to think about. But on the case thus postulated
our young American had as yet had no light:
she only felt that when the light should come it
would greatly deepen the colour; and she liked to
think she was prepared for anything. What she
already knew, moreover, was full to her vision, of
English, of eccentric, of Thackerayan character,
Kate Croy having gradually become not a little explicit
on the subject of her situation, her past, her
present, her general predicament, her small success,
up to the present hour, in contenting at the same time
her father, her sister, her aunt and herself. It was
Milly's subtle guess, imparted to her Susie, that the
girl had somebody else as well, as yet unnamed, to
content, it being manifest that such a creature
couldn't help having; a creature not perhaps, if one
would, exactly formed to inspire passions, since that
always implied a certain silliness, but essentially
seen, by the admiring eye of friendship, under the
clear shadow of some probably eminent male interest.
The clear shadow, from whatever source projected,
hung, at any rate, over Milly's companion the whole
week, and Kate Croy's handsome face smiled out of
it, under bland skylights, in the presence alike of old
masters passive in their glory and of thoroughly new
ones, the newest, who bristled restlessly with pins
and brandished snipping shears.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly, having decided that her own friendly nature made her shy, had found a way to connect with Kate, and they were really enjoying each other's company. This might have been the best time they ever had together, exploring London on their own – the London of stores, streets, and suburbs that Milly found fascinating, and the museums, monuments, and "sights" that were new to Kate. Meanwhile, their parents were occupied elsewhere, both happy about the girls' friendship, each thinking the other's daughter was a wonderful friend. Milly told Susan Shepherd more than once that Kate was hiding something, some kind of hidden worry, on top of everything else she'd been through. She thought that if Kate had helped Mrs. Lowder meet them, it was just to distract herself, to give herself something else to focus on. But Milly, as a young American, didn't know the full story yet. She just felt that when the truth came out, it would be much more complicated than she thought. And she liked to believe she was ready for anything. What she *did* know was that Kate Croy's situation was full of the kind of English, quirky, and slightly old-fashioned things you'd find in a novel. Kate had slowly told Milly about her life, her past, her current problems, her general difficult situation, and how little she'd succeeded in pleasing her father, her sister, her aunt, and herself up to that point. Milly subtly guessed, and told her friend Susie, that Kate also had someone else to please, someone she hadn't mentioned yet. It was obvious that someone like Kate would have someone like that; someone who perhaps wasn't meant to inspire passionate love, since that always seemed a bit silly, but who was clearly very important, likely a prominent man, from the perspective of their friendship. That sense of something important in the background, no matter where it came from, hung over Milly's friend all week. Kate Croy's attractive face smiled out from under the soft light of the city, in the company of both classic, respected paintings and the newest artists, who were bustling with activity and wielding scissors.</i></p></div>

It was meanwhile a pretty part of the intercourse
of these young ladies that each thought the other
more remarkable than herself—that each thought
herself, or assured the other she did, a comparatively
dusty object and the other a favourite of nature and
of fortune. Kate was amused, amazed at the way
her friend insisted on "taking" her, and Milly wondered
if Kate were sincere in finding her the most
extraordinary—quite apart from her being the most
charming—person she had come across. They had
talked, in long drives, and quantities of history had
not been wanting—in the light of which Mrs. Lowder's
niece might superficially seem to have had the
best of the argument. Her visitor's American references,
with their bewildering immensities, their confounding
moneyed New York, their excitements of
high pressure, their opportunities of wild freedom,
their record of used-up relatives, parents, clever,
eager, fair, slim brothers—these the most loved—all
engaged, as well as successive superseded guardians,
in a high extravagance of speculation and dissipation
that had left this exquisite being her black dress, her
white face and her vivid hair as the mere last broken
link: such a picture quite threw into the shade
the brief biography, however sketchily amplified,
of a mere middle-class nobody in Bayswater. And
though that indeed might be but a Bayswater way
of putting it, in addition to which Milly was in the
stage of interest in Bayswater ways, this critic so
far prevailed that, like Mrs. Stringham herself, she
fairly got her companion to accept from her that
she was quite the nearest approach to a practical
princess Bayswater could hope ever to know. It
was a fact—it became one at the end of three days—that
Milly actually began to borrow from the handsome
girl a sort of view of her state; the handsome
girl's impression of it was clearly so sincere. This
impression was a tribute, a tribute positively to
power, power the source of which was the last thing
Kate treated as a mystery. There were passages,
under all their skylights, the succession of their shops
being large, in which the latter's easy, yet the least
bit dry manner sufficiently gave out that if she had
had so deep a pocket——!

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The interesting thing about their friendship was that each of these young women thought the other was more extraordinary than herself. Each one considered herself, or pretended to consider herself, rather ordinary, while she believed the other was favored by both nature and good luck. Kate was amused and surprised by how her friend insisted on admiring her, and Milly wondered if Kate was sincere in thinking her the most fascinating person she’d ever met, aside from being the most charming. They had talked during long drives, and they’d discussed a lot of history—in light of which, Mrs. Lowder’s niece might have superficially seemed to have the upper hand in their discussions. Kate's American background, with its overwhelming scale, its bewilderingly wealthy New York, its fast-paced excitement, its freedom, and its history of relatives who had been exhausted—parents, clever, enthusiastic, attractive, slim brothers (who were most beloved)—all of whom were involved, along with a string of replaced guardians, in an extravagant lifestyle of risky investments and overindulgence. This picture left Kate with just her black dress, her pale face, and her striking hair as the only remaining evidence of her past. This kind of background completely overshadowed the short, even if well-detailed, biography of an average middle-class woman in Bayswater. Although that might have simply been a Bayswater way of looking at it, and Milly was currently quite interested in Bayswater ways, this assessment was so convincing that, like Mrs. Stringham herself, Milly actually got Kate to accept that she was the closest thing to a real princess that Bayswater could ever hope to have. It was a fact—established after just three days—that Milly actually began to adopt Kate’s perspective on her own situation, because Kate’s view of it was clearly so sincere. This impression was a tribute, a tribute to power, and Kate made no secret of where she believed that power came from. There were moments, in all the brightly lit shopping areas, given the size of the shops, when Kate’s easygoing, slightly detached manner was enough to suggest that if she had access to such deep pockets…!</i></p></div>

It was not moreover by any means with not having
the imagination of expenditure that she appeared
to charge her friend, but with not having the imagination
of terror, of thrift, the imagination or in any
degree the habit of a conscious dependence on others.
Such moments, when all Wigmore Street, for instance,
seemed to rustle about and the pale girl herself
to be facing the different rustlers, usually so
undiscriminated, as individual Britons too, Britons
personal, parties to a relation and perhaps even intrinsically
remarkable—such moments in especial determined
in Kate a perception of the high happiness
of her companion's liberty. Milly's range was thus
immense; she had to ask nobody for anything, to
refer nothing to any one; her freedom, her fortune
and her fancy were her law; an obsequious world
surrounded her, she could sniff up at every step its
fumes. And Kate, in these days, was altogether in
the phase of forgiving her so much bliss; in the
phase moreover of believing that, should they continue
to go on together, she would abide in that generosity.
She had, at such a point as this, no suspicion
of a rift within the lute—by which we mean not
only none of anything's coming between them, but
none of any definite flaw in so much clearness of
quality. Yet, all the same, if Milly, at Mrs. Lowder's
banquet, had described herself to Lord Mark
as kindly used by the young woman on the other side
because of some faintly-felt special propriety in it,
so there really did match with this, privately, on the
young woman's part, a feeling not analysed but
divided, a latent impression that Mildred Theale was
not, after all, a person to change places, to change
even chances with. Kate, verily, would perhaps not
quite have known what she meant by this reservation,
and she came near naming it only when she said
to herself that, rich as Milly was, one probably
wouldn't—which was singular—ever hate her for it.
The handsome girl had, with herself, these felicities
and crudities: it wasn't obscure to her that, without
some very particular reason to help, it might have
proved a test of one's philosophy not to be irritated
by a mistress of millions, or whatever they were,
who, as a girl, so easily might have been, like herself,
only vague and fatally female. She was by no
means sure of liking Aunt Maud as much as she deserved,
and Aunt Maud's command of funds was
obviously inferior to Milly's. There was thus
clearly, as pleading for the latter, some influence that
would later on become distinct; and meanwhile, decidedly,
it was enough that she was as charming as
she was queer and as queer as she was charming—all
of which was a rare amusement; as well, for that
matter, as further sufficient that there were objects
of value she had already pressed on Kate's acceptance.
A week of her society in these conditions—conditions
that Milly chose to sum up as ministering
immensely, for a blind, vague pilgrim, to aid and
comfort—announced itself from an early hour as
likely to become a week of presents, acknowledgments,
mementos, pledges of gratitude and admiration
that were all on one side. Kate as promptly
embraced the propriety of making it clear that she
must forswear shops till she should receive some
guarantee that the contents of each one she entered
as a humble companion should not be placed at her
feet; yet that was in truth not before she had found
herself in possession, under whatever protests, of
several precious ornaments and other minor conveniences.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It wasn't that she accused her friend of being extravagant, but rather of lacking the imagination to be afraid, or economical, or the imagination—or even the habit—of relying on others. In those moments, when all of Wigmore Street, for example, seemed to buzz around them, and the pale girl herself was facing the various people—usually indistinguishable, but also individual, unique people—involved in their relationship and perhaps even intrinsically interesting, those moments especially made Kate recognize how happy her friend was to be so free. Milly’s possibilities were vast; she didn’t have to ask anyone for anything, or defer to anyone; her freedom, her wealth, and her whims were her only rules. An attentive world surrounded her, and she could inhale its offerings at every turn. And in those days, Kate was completely in the process of forgiving Milly for having so much joy, and she also believed that if they stayed together, she would continue to be that generous. She had no suspicion at this point of any trouble, meaning not only that nothing would come between them, but also that there was no noticeable flaw in their apparently perfect relationship. However, even so, if Milly, at Mrs. Lowder’s party, had described herself to Lord Mark as being treated kindly by the young woman on the other side of her because she felt a certain subtle sense of appropriateness in it, then in truth there was something similar happening privately on the young woman's part, a feeling that wasn't fully understood but was divided, a hidden impression that Mildred Theale was not, after all, someone Kate would want to trade places or chances with. Kate wouldn't quite have known what she meant by this reservation, and she almost clarified it when she told herself that, rich as Milly was, one probably wouldn't—and this was strange—ever hate her for it. The beautiful girl had these good and bad qualities: it wasn't a secret that, without some very specific reason to help, it might have been a test of one's philosophy not to be annoyed by a woman who had millions, or whatever, who, as a girl, could so easily have been just as vague and inevitably female as she was. She definitely wasn't sure she liked Aunt Maud as much as she deserved, and Aunt Maud's wealth was obviously less than Milly's. Therefore, there was a clear advantage to Milly's position that would become more distinct later on; and for the time being, it was enough that she was as delightful as she was strange, and as strange as she was delightful—which was all very entertaining. Additionally, it was also sufficient that there were valuable gifts she had already given to Kate. A week of her company in these circumstances—circumstances that Milly chose to describe as tremendously helping and comforting a blind, vague pilgrim—was turning out to be a week of presents, acknowledgments, souvenirs, pledges of gratitude and admiration all coming from one side. Kate quickly agreed that she must stop shopping until she could be sure that the items in any store she entered as a humble companion wouldn't be offered to her; yet that was really only after she had found herself in possession, despite her protests, of several precious ornaments and other small conveniences.</i></p></div>

Great was the absurdity, too, that there should
have come a day, by the end of the week, when it
appeared that all Milly would have asked in definite
"return," as might be said, was to be told a little
about Lord Mark and to be promised the privilege
of a visit to Mrs. Condrip. Far other amusements
had been offered her, but her eagerness was shamelessly
human, and she seemed really to count more
on the revelation of the anxious lady of Chelsea than
on the best nights of the opera. Kate admired, and
showed it, such an absence of fear: to the fear of
being bored, in such a connection, she would have
been so obviously entitled. Milly's answer to this
was the plea of her curiosities—which left her
friend wondering as to their odd direction. Some
among them, no doubt, were rather more intelligible,
and Kate had heard without wonder that she was
blank about Lord Mark. This young lady's account
of him, at the same time, professed itself as frankly
imperfect; for what they best knew him by at Lancaster
Gate was a thing difficult to explain. One
knew people in general by something they had to
show, something that, either for them or against,
could be touched or named or proved; and she could
think of no other case of a value taken as so great
and yet flourishing untested. His value was his
future, which had somehow got itself as accepted
by Aunt Maud as if it had been his good cook or his
steam-launch. She, Kate, didn't mean she thought
him a humbug; he might do great things—but they
were all, as yet, so to speak, he had done. On the
other hand it was of course something of an achievement,
and not open to every one, to have got one's self
taken so seriously by Aunt Maud. The best
thing about him, doubtless, on the whole, was that
Aunt Maud believed in him. She was often fantastic,
but she knew a humbug, and—no, Lord Mark
wasn't that. He had been a short time in the House,
on the Tory side, but had lost his seat on the first
opportunity, and this was all he had to point to.
However, he pointed to nothing; which was very
possibly just a sign of his real cleverness, one of
those that the really clever had in common with the
really void. Even Aunt Maud frequently admitted
that there was a good deal, for her view of him, to
come up in the rear. And he wasn't meanwhile
himself indifferent—indifferent to himself—for
he was working Lancaster Gate for all it was
worth: just as it was, no doubt, working <i>him,</i>
and just as the working and the worked were in
London, as one might explain, the parties to every
relation.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was also pretty absurd that, by the end of the week, it seemed all Milly wanted in exchange for everything was to hear a bit about Lord Mark and be promised a visit to Mrs. Condrip. She'd been offered other things, but her enthusiasm was completely normal, and she seemed more excited about getting information from the worried lady in Chelsea than attending the best opera performances. Kate admired this lack of fear, and made it clear; Milly, in her position, would have been completely justified in being afraid of being bored. Milly's explanation was her curiosity, which made her friend wonder why she was interested in those particular things. Some of her curiosities were easier to understand, and Kate wasn’t surprised to hear that Milly knew very little about Lord Mark. Kate’s own description of him was also honestly incomplete because it was hard to describe him based on what they knew at Lancaster Gate. One usually knew people by what they had to show, something that could be seen, named, or proven. But she couldn't think of another instance where someone's worth was so high and yet unproven. His worth was based on his future, which Aunt Maud had somehow accepted as fact, just as if he had a good cook or a steam-powered boat. Kate wasn’t suggesting he was a fraud; he might do great things—but as of now, he hadn’t done anything. On the other hand, getting Aunt Maud to take you so seriously was certainly an accomplishment that not everyone could achieve. The best thing about him, no doubt, was that Aunt Maud believed in him. She was often eccentric, but she could spot a fake, and, no, Lord Mark wasn't that. He’d briefly been a member of Parliament, a Conservative, but had lost his seat right away, and that was all he could point to. However, he didn't point to anything, which might be a sign of his intelligence, one of those traits that the truly clever people shared with those who were empty-headed. Even Aunt Maud often admitted that there was a lot about him that remained to be seen. And in the meantime, he wasn’t indifferent—indifferent to himself—as he was actively trying to exploit Lancaster Gate: just as, no doubt, it was exploiting him, and just as the one who does the exploiting and the one who is exploited are, in London, the two sides of every relationship.</i></p></div>

Kate did explain, for her listening friend: every
one who had anything to give—it was true they were
the fewest—made the sharpest possible bargain for
it, got at least its value in return. The strangest
thing, furthermore, was that this might be, in cases,
a happy understanding. The worker in one connection
was the worked in another; it was as broad as
it was long—with the wheels of the system, as might
be seen, wonderfully oiled. People could quite like
each other in the midst of it, as Aunt Maud, by every
appearance, quite liked Lord Mark, and as Lord
Mark, it was to be hoped, liked Mrs. Lowder, since
if he didn't he was a greater brute than one could believe.
She, Kate, had not yet, it was true, made out
what he was doing for her—besides which the dear
woman needed him, even at the most he could do,
much less than she imagined; so far as all of which
went, moreover, there were plenty of things on every
side she had not yet made out. She believed, on the
whole, in any one Aunt Maud took up; and she gave
it to Milly as worth thinking of that, whatever wonderful
people this young lady might meet in the land,
she would meet no more extraordinary woman.
There were greater celebrities by the million, and of
course greater swells, but a bigger <i>person,</i> by Kate's
view, and a larger natural handful every way, would
really be far to seek. When Milly inquired with interest
if Kate's belief in <i>her</i> was primarily on the
lines of what Mrs. Lowder "took up," her interlocutress
could handsomely say yes, since by the same
principle she believed in herself. Whom but Aunt
Maud's niece, pre-eminently, had Aunt Maud taken
up, and who was thus more in the current, with her,
of working and of being worked? "You may ask,"
Kate said, "what in the world I have to give; and
that indeed is just what I'm trying to learn. There
must be something, for her to think she can get it
out of me. She <i>will</i> get it—trust her; and then I
shall see what it is; which I beg you to believe I
should never have found out for myself." She declined
to treat any question of Milly's own "paying"
power as discussable; that Milly would pay a
hundred per cent.—and even to the end, doubtless,
through the nose—was just the beautiful basis on
which they found themselves.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate explained to her friend Milly: everyone who had something to offer – and those people were the fewest – drove the hardest possible bargain, getting at least its value in return. The strangest thing was that this could, in some cases, be a mutually beneficial arrangement. The person using someone else was also being used by someone else; it was a fair exchange – with the gears of the system, as you could see, running smoothly. People could genuinely like each other within it, just as Aunt Maud, seemingly, liked Lord Mark, and hopefully, Lord Mark liked Mrs. Lowder. Otherwise, he was a bigger jerk than one would imagine.</i></p><p><i>Kate hadn't yet figured out what Lord Mark was doing for her – and the dear woman needed him, even with what he was doing, which was less than she realized. Besides that, there were plenty of things she hadn't figured out on all sides. She generally trusted anyone Aunt Maud approved of. And she told Milly that it was worth considering that, no matter how many impressive people Milly might meet, she wouldn't meet a more extraordinary woman than Aunt Maud. There were millions of more famous people, and of course, more wealthy people, but Kate thought it would be difficult to find anyone more impressive, or with more natural strength.</i></p><p><i>When Milly asked if Kate's belief in her was based primarily on Aunt Maud's approval, Kate could honestly say yes, because she believed in herself based on the same principle. Who else had Aunt Maud taken under her wing, more than her own niece? Who was more involved in this system of using and being used, alongside her? "You might ask," Kate said, "what I have to offer. That’s exactly what I’m trying to figure out. There must be something, for her to think she can get something from me. She will get it – trust her. And then I’ll see what it is, which I swear I would never have figured out on my own." She refused to discuss the idea of Milly "paying" for anything; that Milly would pay generously – and likely be taken advantage of in the end – was the very foundation of their relationship.</i></p></div>

These were fine facilities, pleasantries, ironies, all
these luxuries of gossip and philosophies of London
and of life, and they became quickly, between the
pair, the common form of talk, Milly professing herself
delighted to know that something was to be done
with her. If the most remarkable woman in England
was to do it, so much the better, and if the most
remarkable woman in England had them both in
hand together, why, what could be jollier for each?
When she reflected indeed a little on the oddity of
her wanting two at once, Kate had the natural reply
that it was exactly what showed her sincerity. She
invariably gave way to feeling, and feeling had distinctly
popped up in her on the advent of her girlhood's
friend. The way the cat would jump was
always, in presence of anything that moved her, interesting
to see; visibly enough, moreover, for a
long time, it hadn't jumped anything like so far.
This, in fact, as we already know, remained the marvel
for Milly Theale, who, on sight of Mrs. Lowder,
found fifty links in respect to Susie absent from the
chain of association. She knew so herself what she
thought of Susie that she would have expected the
lady of Lancaster Gate to think something quite different;
the failure of which endlessly mystified her.
But her mystification was the cause for her of another
fine impression, inasmuch as when she went
so far as to observe to Kate that Susan Shepherd—and
especially Susan Shepherd emerging so uninvited
from an irrelevant past—ought, by all the proprieties,
simply to have bored Aunt Maud, her confidant
agreed with her without a protest and abounded
in the sense of her wonder. Susan Shepherd at
least bored the niece—that was plain; this young
woman saw nothing in her—nothing to account for
anything, not even for Milly's own indulgence:
which little fact became in turn to the latter's mind
a fact of significance. It was a light on the handsome
girl—representing more than merely showed—that
poor Susie was simply as nought to her. This
was, in a manner too, a general admonition to poor
Susie's companion, who seemed to see marked by it
the direction in which she had best most look out.

It just faintly rankled in her that a person who was
good enough and to spare for Milly Theale shouldn't
be good enough for another girl; though, oddly
enough, she could easily have forgiven Mrs. Lowder
herself the impatience. Mrs. Lowder didn't feel it,
and Kate Croy felt it with ease; yet in the end, be
it added, she grasped the reason, and the reason enriched
her mind. Wasn't it sufficiently the reason
that the handsome girl was, with twenty other splendid
qualities, the least bit brutal too, and didn't she
suggest, as no one yet had ever done for her new
friend, that there might be a wild beauty in that, and
even a strange grace? Kate wasn't brutally brutal—which
Milly had hitherto benightedly supposed
the only way; she wasn't even aggressively so, but
rather indifferently, defensively and, as might be
said, by the habit of anticipation. She simplified in
advance, was beforehand with her doubts, and knew
with singular quickness what she wasn't, as they
said in New York, going to like. In that way at
least people were clearly quicker in England than at
home; and Milly could quite see, after a little, how
such instincts might become usual in a world in
which dangers abounded. There were more dangers,
clearly, round about Lancaster Gate than one
suspected in New York or could dream of in Boston.
At all events, with more sense of them, there were
more precautions, and it was a remarkable world
altogether in which there could be precautions, on
whatever ground, against Susie.

Didn't this girl, for the first time, hint to Kate's new friend that there might be something wild and beautiful, even graceful, in that insensitivity? Kate wasn't overtly cruel, which Milly had mistakenly thought was the only kind of cruelty. She wasn't even aggressively cruel, but rather indifferent, defensive, and as though she'd developed the habit of anticipating negativity. She made assumptions in advance, preempted her own doubts, and knew almost immediately what she wouldn't like. In that way, at least, people in England seemed faster to judge than people back home. Milly could quickly see how such instincts might be common in a world full of threats. There were clearly more dangers around Lancaster Gate than anyone in New York even suspected or in Boston could imagine.
