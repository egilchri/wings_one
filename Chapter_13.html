<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>After leaving a meeting, a woman walks alone through London without a set destination. She passes through unknown streets until she arrives at Regent's Park. She enters the park, finds an empty bench, and sits down to rest. After some time, she gets up and leaves.</p><p>For the next day or two, she deceives her companion, Susie.</p><p>That evening, her friend Kate Croy arrives at the hotel in a hansom cab. The woman, Milly, sees Kate arrive from a balcony, and they exchange nods and smiles. Kate comes up to the sitting-room and asks what the doctor said. Milly replies that it is "all right," that there is nothing to worry about, and that she can do as she likes. Kate kisses her. Milly elaborates that she is to travel and go to places for pleasure. She asks Kate to help her, and Kate agrees.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly**</li>
Milly is initially presented in a state of agitated excitement, energized by a "distinguished friend's" words. This propels her into a solitary walk through London, which she frames as a "great adventure," a military-like march into a new, uncertain life. Her situation shifts dramatically as she sits in Regent's Park. Her initial feeling of empowerment dissolves into physical and emotional exhaustion. Her thinking turns analytical and suspicious, leading her to reinterpret the friend's kindness not as encouragement, but as a "chilling" form of pity for a grave, unspoken condition. This realization transforms her from an adventurer into a "poor girl" facing a dire reality. In her final interaction, she undergoes another immediate shift, choosing to perform a role. Confronted with Kate’s vitality, she conceals her internal crisis and presents a facade of perfect health and freedom, actively creating a false narrative about her situation.
<li>*The "Distinguished Friend" (Doctor)**</li>
He is presented entirely through Milly’s shifting interpretations. Initially, he is an empowering figure whose advice to "be active" acts as a "final push" into a new life. As Milly’s mood sours, her perception of him changes. He becomes a man who is "bolstering" the weak, treating her with a "beneficent dishonesty" and a compassion she finds "divesting, denuding, exposing." He is less a character in his own right and more a catalyst for Milly's internal transformations.
<li>*Susan (Susie) Shepherd**</li>
Susan is portrayed as a companion whose defining characteristic is an almost reverent, "Byzantine" consideration for Milly. She is presented as someone who intentionally spares Milly from difficult questions, treating her with the deference due to a "princess." Her situation is that of an unwitting observer, kept at a distance by her own courtly manners, which Milly now uses to help conceal her true state.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li></ul>
Kate is presented as a figure of vibrant, direct, and uncomplicated health. Her arrival is energetic and her questioning is straightforward ("Well, what?"). She is characterized by her physical splendor and what Milly perceives as a "practical impeccability." Her situation is that of a confidante who is actively deceived. She immediately and enthusiastically accepts Milly's lie, her cheerful assumptions providing the perfect audience for Milly’s new performance of well-being.

<p>
She had gone out with these last words so in her
ears that when once she was well away—back this
time in the great square alone—it was as if some
instant application of them had opened out there before
her. It was positively, this effect, an excitement
that carried her on; she went forward into
space under the sense of an impulse received—an
impulse simple and direct, easy above all to act upon.
She was borne up for the hour, and now she knew
why she had wanted to come by herself. No one
in the world could have sufficiently entered into her
state; no tie would have been close enough to enable
a companion to walk beside her without some disparity.
She literally felt, in this first flush, that her
only company must be the human race at large,
present all round her, but inspiringly impersonal,
and that her only field must be, then and there, the
grey immensity of London. Grey immensity had
somehow of a sudden become her element; grey immensity
was what her distinguished friend had, for
the moment, furnished her world with and what the
question of "living," as he put it to her, living by
option, by volition, inevitably took on for its immediate
face. She went straight before her, without
weakness, altogether with strength; and still as she
went she was more glad to be alone, for nobody—not
Kate Croy, not Susan Shepherd either—would
have wished to rush with her as she rushed. She
had asked him at the last whether, being on foot,
she might go home so, or elsewhere, and he had replied
as if almost amused again at her extravagance:
"You're active, luckily, by nature—it's beautiful:
therefore rejoice in it. <i>Be</i> active, without folly—for
you're not foolish: be as active as you can and
as you like." That had been in fact the final push,
as well as the touch that most made a mixture of
her consciousness—a strange mixture that tasted at
one and the same time of what she had lost and what
had been given her. It was wonderful to her, while
she took her random course, that these quantities felt
so equal: she had been treated—hadn't she?—as if
it were in her power to live; and yet one wasn't
treated so—was one?—unless it came up, quite as
much, that one might die. The beauty of the bloom
had gone from the small old sense of safety—that
was distinct: she had left it behind her there forever.
But the beauty of the idea of a great adventure, a big
dim experiment or struggle in which she might,
more responsibly than ever before, take a hand, had
been offered her instead. It was as if she had had to
pluck off her breast, to throw away, some friendly
ornament, a familiar flower, a little old jewel, that
was part of her daily dress; and to take up and
shoulder as a substitute some queer defensive
weapon, a musket, a spear, a battle-axe conducive
possibly in a higher degree to a striking appearance,
but demanding all the effort of the military posture.
She felt this instrument, for that matter, already
on her back, so that she proceeded now in very truth
as a soldier on a march—proceeded as if, for her
initiation, the first charge had been sounded. She
passed along unknown streets, over dusty littery
ways, between long rows of fronts not enhanced by
the August light; she felt good for miles and only
wanted to get lost; there were moments at corners,
where she stopped and chose her direction, in which
she quite lived up to his injunction to rejoice that she
was active. It was like a new pleasure to have so
new a reason; she would affirm, without delay, her
option, her volition; taking this personal possession
of what surrounded her was a fair affirmation to
start with; and she really didn't care if she made
it at the cost of alarms for Susie. Susie would wonder
in due course "whatever," as they said at the
hotel, had become of her; yet this would be nothing
either, probably, to wonderments still in store.
Wonderments in truth, Milly felt, even now attended
her steps: it was quite as if she saw in people's eyes
the reflection of her appearance and pace. She
found herself moving at times in regions visibly not
haunted by odd-looking girls from New York, duskily
draped, sable-plumed, all but incongruously shod
and gazing about them with extravagance; she
might, from the curiosity she clearly excited in byways,
in side-streets peopled with grimy children
and costermongers carts, which she hoped were
slums, literally have had her musket on her shoulder,
have announced herself as freshly on the warpath.
But for the fear of overdoing this character she
would here and there have begun conversation, have
asked her way; in spite of the fact that, as that
would help the requirements of adventure, her way
was exactly what she wanted not to know. The
difficulty was that she at last accidentally found it;
she had come out, she presently saw, at the Regent's
Park, round which, on two or three occasions with
Kate Croy, her public chariot had solemnly rolled.
But she went into it further now; this was the real
thing; the real thing was to be quite away from the
pompous roads, well within the centre and on the
stretches of shabby grass. Here were benches and
smutty sheep; here were idle lads at games of ball,
with their cries mild in the thick air; here were wanderers,
anxious and tired like herself; here doubtless
were hundreds of others just in the same box.
Their box, their great common anxiety, what was it,
in this grim breathing-space, but the practical question
of life? They could live if they would; that
is, like herself, they had been told so; she saw them
all about her, on seats, digesting the information,
feeling it altered, assimilated, recognising it again
as something, in a slightly different shape, familiar
enough, the blessed old truth that they would live
if they could. All she thus shared with them made
her wish to sit in their company; which she so far
did that she looked for a bench that was empty, eschewing
a still emptier chair that she saw hard by
and for which she would have paid, with superiority,
a fee.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She was still hearing those last words. When she got far enough away, back in the big square all alone, it was as if their meaning had suddenly become clear. In fact, this feeling was an exciting one that pushed her forward. She entered the space with a sense of purpose – a simple, clear impulse that was easy to act on. She felt energized for the moment, and now she understood why she'd wanted to be alone. No one in the world could have fully understood her situation; no close relationship could allow a companion to walk beside her without some misunderstanding. She literally felt, in this first rush of emotion, that her only company must be the entire human race, present all around her but inspiringly impersonal, and that her only arena must be the gray vastness of London. That gray vastness had suddenly become her element. It was what her distinguished friend had, for the time being, provided her with, and what the question of "living," as he put it, living by choice and will, inevitably presented as its immediate challenge.</i></p><p><i>She walked straight ahead without weakness, full of strength. She was increasingly glad to be alone, because nobody—not Kate Croy, not Susan Shepherd—would have wanted to rush with her as she was rushing. She had asked him at the end whether she could walk home or go elsewhere, since she was on foot, and he had replied almost amused by her enthusiasm: "You're naturally active, which is wonderful. So, enjoy it. Be active, without being foolish—because you aren't. Be as active as you can and as you like." That had been the final push and the thing that most mixed up her thoughts – a strange mix that tasted of both what she'd lost and what she'd been given. It was amazing to her, as she wandered along, that these things felt so equal. She had been treated – hadn't she? – as if it were in her power to live. And yet, you wouldn't be treated like that – would you? – unless it was also clear that you might die. The beauty of security was gone. She had left it behind her forever. But instead, she'd been offered the beauty of the idea of a great adventure, a big experiment or struggle in which she could take part with more responsibility than ever before. It was as if she'd had to take off and throw away some friendly ornament, a familiar flower, a little old jewel that was part of her everyday appearance, and pick up and carry instead some strange defensive weapon, a musket, a spear, or a battle-axe. Those weapons could possibly make her appear more striking, but they required a soldier's effort.</i></p><p><i>She already felt this instrument on her back.

There were moments at corners, where she stopped and chose her direction, in which she completely lived up to his instruction to enjoy her activity. It was a new pleasure to have such a new reason. She would immediately declare her choice and her will. Taking personal ownership of what surrounded her was a fair declaration to start with. She didn't really care if she caused worry for Susie. Susie would eventually wonder what had happened to her, as they said at the hotel. But this wouldn't be anything compared to the other things she might have to deal with. Milly felt that wonderings truly accompanied her steps even now. It was as if she saw her appearance and the pace of her actions reflected in people's eyes. She found herself moving through areas where she saw few odd-looking girls from New York, darkly dressed with sable plumes. They seemed strangely shod and gazed around with extravagance. From the curiosity she clearly aroused in side streets populated by dirty children and costermongers' carts, which she hoped were slums, she could have literally had her musket on her shoulder and announced herself as newly on the warpath.</i></p><p><i>But, for fear of overdoing it, she resisted the urge to begin conversations and ask for directions. She actually didn't want to know the way, as that would help the adventure's requirements. The problem was that she eventually found it by accident.

Here were idle boys playing ball, their cries softened by the thick air. Here were wanderers, anxious and tired like herself. Doubtless, hundreds of others were in the same situation. What was their shared anxiety in this somber moment but the practical question of life? They could live if they chose; that is, they'd been told as much, just like her. She saw them all around her, on seats, absorbing the information, feeling it changed, integrated, recognizing it again as something slightly familiar, the old truth that they would live if they could. All she shared with them made her want to sit with them. She looked for an empty bench, avoiding a chair nearby that was even emptier and for which she would have had to pay a fee with a feeling of superiority.</i></p></div>

<p>
The last scrap of superiority had soon enough left
her, if only because she before long knew herself for
more tired than she had proposed. This and the
charm, after a fashion, of the situation in itself made
her linger and rest; there was a sort of spell in the
sense that nobody in the world knew where she was.
It was the first time in her life that this had happened;
somebody, everybody appeared to have
known before, at every instant of it, where she was;
so that she was now suddenly able to put it to herself
that that hadn't been a life. This present kind
of thing therefore might be—which was where precisely
her distinguished friend seemed to be wishing
her to come out. He wished her also, it was true,
not to make, as she was perhaps doing now, too much
of her isolation; at the same time however as he
clearly desired to deny her no decent source of interest.
He was interested—she arrived at that—in
her appealing to as many sources as possible; and it
fairly filtered into her, as she sat and sat, that he was
essentially propping her up. Had she been doing it
herself she would have called it bolstering—the bolstering
that was simply for the weak; and she
thought and thought as she put together the proofs
that it was as one of the weak he was treating her.
It was of course as one of the weak that she had gone
to him—but, oh, with how sneaking a hope that he
might pronounce her, as to all indispensables, a veritable
young lioness! What indeed she was really
confronted with was the consciousness that he had
not, after all, pronounced her anything: she nursed
herself into the sense that he had beautifully got out
of it. Did he think, however, she wondered, that
he could keep out of it to the end?—though, as she
weighed the question, she yet felt it a little unjust.
Milly weighed, in this extraordinary hour, questions
numerous and strange; but she had, happily, before
she moved, worked round to a simplification.
Stranger than anything, for instance, was the effect
of its rolling over her that, when one considered it,
he might perhaps have "got out" by one door but
to come in with a beautiful, beneficent dishonesty by
another. It kept her more intensely motionless
there that what he might fundamentally be "up to"
was some disguised intention of standing by her as a
friend. Wasn't that what women always said they
wanted to do when they deprecated the addresses of
gentlemen they couldn't more intimately go on with?
It was what they, no doubt, sincerely fancied they
could make of men of whom they couldn't make
husbands. And she didn't even reason that it was,
by a similar law, the expedient of doctors in general
for the invalids of whom they couldn't make patients:
she was somehow so sufficiently aware that
<i>her</i> doctor was—however fatuous it might sound—exceptionally
moved. This was the damning little
fact—if she could talk of damnation: that she could
believe herself to have caught him in the act of irrelevantly
liking her. She hadn't gone to him to be
liked, she had gone to him to be judged; and he was
quite a great enough man to be in the habit, as a
rule, of observing the difference. She could like
<i>him,</i> as she distinctly did—that was another matter;
all the more that her doing so was now, so obviously
for herself, compatible with judgment. Yet it
would have been all portentously mixed had not, as
we say, a final, merciful wave, chilling rather, but
washing clear, come to her assistance.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Her sense of being superior quickly faded, probably because she realized she was more exhausted than she'd admitted. This, along with a certain appeal to the situation itself, made her stay put and relax. There was something magical about knowing that no one in the world knew where she was. It was a first for her; it seemed as if, up to now, someone, everyone, had always known her whereabouts. Now she could finally admit to herself that what she’d experienced until now hadn’t been a real life. This new experience, then, might be the true thing—which was precisely the goal her distinguished friend seemed to be encouraging. He also, it was true, wished her not to dwell too much on her isolation, as she might be doing now, while clearly wanting to allow her every reasonable opportunity for interest. He was interested—she realized—in her drawing on as many sources of interest as possible; and it gradually dawned on her, as she sat and sat, that he was essentially supporting her. If she were the one doing it, she’d call it coddling—the kind of support reserved for the weak. And she thought and thought as she considered the evidence, concluding that he was treating her as one of the weak. Of course, that's how she had approached him—but with a secret hope that he might declare her a formidable, young woman! In reality, she was facing the realization that he hadn't declared her anything. She began to feel he had artfully avoided doing so. Did he think, she wondered, that he could avoid it indefinitely? Even as she considered the question, she felt it was a little unfair. During this extraordinary time, Milly wrestled with many strange questions, but thankfully, she reached a simplification before she moved. What was stranger than anything, for instance, was the realization that, considering it, he might have “got out” of one commitment only to come back in through another, with a kind, dishonest intent. It kept her rooted there as she considered whether his fundamental aim was a disguised plan to befriend her. Wasn't that what women always said they wanted when they rejected the advances of men they couldn't be more intimate with? It's what they sincerely thought they could make of men they couldn't make husbands. And she didn't even reason that it was, by a similar principle, the strategy of doctors in general toward the patients they couldn't cure. She was somehow very much aware that her doctor was—however ridiculous it sounded—exceptionally moved by her. This was the damning fact—if she could speak of damnation: that she could believe she had caught him in the act of irrationally liking her. She hadn't gone to him to be liked; she had gone to him to be judged; and he was a great enough man to be in the habit, as a rule, of understanding the difference. She could like him, as she distinctly did—that was another matter; all the more so because her feeling for him was now, obviously for herself, compatible with judgment. Yet it would have all been terribly confused if a final, merciful wave hadn't come to her rescue, a wave that chilled her a bit but clarified everything.</i></p></div>

It came, of a sudden, when all other thought was
spent. She had been asking herself why, if her case
was grave—and she knew what she meant by that—he
should have talked to her at all about what she
might with futility "do"; or why on the other
hand, if it were light, he should attach an importance
to the office of friendship. She had him, with her
little lonely acuteness—as acuteness went during the
dog-days in the Regent's Park—in a cleft stick: she
either mattered, and then she was ill; or she didn't
matter, and then she was well enough. Now he was
"acting," as they said at home, as if she did matter—until
he should prove the contrary. It was too
evident that a person at his high pressure must keep
his inconsistencies, which were probably his highest
amusements, only for the very greatest occasions.
Her prevision, in fine, of just where she should catch
him furnished the light of that judgment in which
we describe her as daring to indulge. And the
judgment it was that made her sensation simple.
He <i>had</i> distinguished her—that was the chill. He
hadn't known—how could he?—that she was devilishly
subtle, subtle exactly in the manner of the suspected,
the suspicious, the condemned. He in fact
confessed to it, in his way, as to an interest in her
combinations, her funny race, her funny losses, her
funny gains, her funny freedom, and, no doubt,
above all, her funny manners—funny, like those of
Americans at their best, without being vulgar, legitimating
amiability and helping to pass it off. In his
appreciation of these redundancies he dressed out for
her the compassion he so signally permitted himself
to waste; but its operation for herself was as directly
divesting, denuding, exposing. It reduced her to
her ultimate state, which was that of a poor girl
with her rent to pay for example—staring before
her in a great city. Milly had her rent to pay, her
rent for her future; everything else but how to meet
it fell away from her in pieces, in tatters. This was
the sensation the great man had doubtless not purposed.
Well, she must go home, like the poor girl,
and see. There might after all be ways; the poor
girl too would be thinking. It came back for that
matter perhaps to views already presented. She
looked about her again, on her feet, at her scattered,
melancholy comrades—some of them so melancholy
as to be down on their stomachs in the grass, turned
away, ignoring, burrowing; she saw once more,
with them, those two faces of the question between
which there was so little to choose for inspiration.
It was perhaps superficially more striking that one
could live if one would; but it was more appealing,
insinuating, irresistible, in short, that one would live
if one could.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It hit her suddenly, when she’d exhausted all other thoughts. She’d been wondering why, if her situation was serious – and she knew what she meant by that – he would have talked to her at all about things she might fruitlessly “do.” Alternatively, if it wasn’t serious, why would he make so much of their friendship? Her cleverness, as sharp as it got during the lazy summer days in Regent's Park, had him trapped. Either she mattered, and was therefore ill, or she didn’t matter, and was fine. Now, he was “acting,” as they’d say back home, as if she did matter – until he proved otherwise. It was obvious someone so important saved their inconsistencies, which were probably his greatest entertainment, for the most important situations. Her ability to predict his behavior provided the foundation for her daring judgment. And it was that judgment that made her feeling simple. He'd singled her out – that was the cold truth. He didn’t know – how could he? – that she was incredibly perceptive, perceptive in the same way as someone suspicious, under suspicion, or condemned. He actually admitted it, in his own way, by showing interest in her complex personality, her quirks, her failures, her successes, her freedom, and, undoubtedly, above all, her amusing behavior – amusing, like the best Americans, without being crude, justifying friendliness and helping to gloss it over. In acknowledging these aspects, he displayed the compassion he so easily allowed himself to feel; but for her, the effect was directly stripping away everything, leaving her exposed. It reduced her to her core state, that of a poor woman with her rent to pay – staring out at the great city. Milly had to pay her rent, her rent for her future; everything else but how to manage that crumbled away. This was the sensation the great man surely hadn’t intended. Well, she had to go home, like that poor woman, and figure it out. Maybe there were options; the poor woman would be thinking too. It possibly went back to ideas that had already been brought up. She looked around again, standing, at her scattered, sad companions – some so sad they were lying face down in the grass, avoiding the world, hiding; she saw again, with them, the two sides of the dilemma, both equally uninspiring. It was perhaps more immediately striking that one could live if one tried; but it was more appealing, seductive, irresistible, that one *would* live if one could.</i></p></div>

She found after this, for the day or two, more
amusement than she had ventured to count on in
the fact, if it were not a mere fancy, of deceiving
Susie; and she presently felt that what made the
difference was the mere fancy—as this <i>was</i> one—of
a countermove to her great man. His taking on
himself—should he do so—to get at her companion
made her suddenly, she held, irresponsible, made any
notion of her own all right for her; though indeed
at the very moment she invited herself to enjoy this
impunity she became aware of new matter for surprise,
or at least for speculation. Her idea would
rather have been that Mrs. Stringham would have
looked at her hard—her sketch of the grounds of
her long, independent excursion showing, she could
feel, as almost cynically superficial. Yet the dear
woman so failed, in the event, to avail herself of any
right of criticism that it was sensibly tempting, for
an hour, to wonder if Kate Croy had been playing
perfectly fair. Hadn't she possibly, from motives
of the highest benevolence, promptings of the finest
anxiety, just given poor Susie what she would have
called the straight tip? It must immediately be
mentioned, however, that, quite apart from a remembrance
of the distinctness of Kate's promise, Milly,
the next thing, found her explanation in a truth that
had the merit of being general. If Susie, at this
crisis, suspiciously spared her, it was really that
Susie was always suspiciously sparing her—yet occasionally,
too, with portentous and exceptional
mercies. The girl was conscious of how she dropped
at times into inscrutable, impenetrable deferences—attitudes
that, though without at all intending it,
made a difference for familiarity, for the ease of intimacy.
It was as if she recalled herself to manners,
to the law of court-etiquette—which last note above
all helped our young woman to a just appreciation.
It was definite for her, even if not quite solid, that
to treat her as a princess was a positive need of her
companion's mind; wherefore she couldn't help it if
this lady had her transcendent view of the way the
class in question were treated. Susan had read history,
had read Gibbon and Froude and Saint-Simon;
she had high-lights as to the special allowances made
for the class, and, since she saw them, when young,
as effete and overtutored, inevitably ironic and infinitely
refined, one must take it for amusing if she
inclined to an indulgence verily Byzantine. If one
<i>could</i> only be Byzantine!—wasn't <i>that</i> what she insidiously
led one on to sigh? Milly tried to oblige
her—for it really placed Susan herself so handsomely
to be Byzantine now. The great ladies of that
race—it would be somewhere in Gibbon—weren't,
apparently, questioned about their mysteries. But
oh, poor Milly and hers! Susan at all events proved
scarce more inquisitive than if she had been a mosaic
at Ravenna. Susan was a porcelain monument to
the odd moral that consideration might, like cynicism,
have abysses. Besides, the Puritan finally
disencumbered——! What starved generations
wasn't Mrs. Stringham, in fancy, going to make up
for?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>After this, for a day or two, she found more amusement than she had expected, if it wasn't just a fantasy, in the fact that she was deceiving Susie. She quickly realized the difference came from the simple idea – like this one – of a countermove against her "great man" (probably Merton Densher). If he took it upon himself to pursue her friend, she suddenly felt it made her unaccountable, making her own choices feel okay. But even as she embraced this freedom, she started noticing new things to be surprised by or at least think about.</i></p><p><i>Her expectation was that Mrs. Stringham would scrutinize her – her casual explanation for her long, independent trip must seem almost cynically superficial, she felt.

Hadn't Kate possibly, out of a genuine desire to help and a deep concern, given poor Susie the “straight scoop”?</i></p><p><i>However, it’s important to say that, setting aside the memory of Kate's clear promise, Milly's next thought offered a reason that was universally true. If Susie was unusually gentle with her at this time, it was really just because Susie was always suspiciously gentle with her – though sometimes also displaying remarkable, extraordinary kindness. Milly was aware of how Susie sometimes adopted impenetrable, inscrutable levels of deference – behaviors that, without meaning to, created distance from familiarity and ease. It was as if Susie was recalling herself to good manners, the rules of formal etiquette – which, more than anything else, helped Milly understand. It was clear to her, even if not fully convincing, that treating her like a princess was a need for her friend. So, she couldn’t fault Susie if she had this grand idea of how the upper class were treated. Susan had read history, including Gibbon, Froude, and Saint-Simon. She was sensitive to the special privileges of the upper class, and since she viewed them as young, as exhausted and overeducated, inevitably ironic and refined, one should find it amusing that she leaned toward a Byzantine style of indulgence.</i></p><p><i>“If only one could be Byzantine!” – wasn't that what Susie subtly encouraged her to long for? Milly tried to accommodate her – because it really made Susie look good to be Byzantine now. The great ladies of that era – somewhere in Gibbon, I believe – were apparently never questioned about their secrets. But oh, poor Milly and hers! Susie, in the end, showed no more curiosity than a mosaic at Ravenna. Susie was a delicate monument to the strange idea that consideration, like cynicism, could have its own dark depths. Besides, the Puritan finally gets rid of the…! What starved generations, in her imagination, was Mrs. Stringham going to make up for?</i></p></div>

Kate Croy came straight to the hotel—came that
evening shortly before dinner; specifically and publicly
moreover, in a hansom that, driven apparently
very fast, pulled up beneath their windows almost
with the clatter of an accident, a "smash." Milly,
alone, as happened, in the great garnished void of
their sitting-room, where, a little, really, like a caged
Byzantine, she had been pacing through the queer,
long-drawn, almost sinister delay of night, an effect
she yet liked—Milly, at the sound, one of the French
windows standing open, passed out to the balcony
that overhung, with pretensions, the general entrance,
and so was in time for the look that Kate,
alighting, paying her cabman, happened to send up
to the front. The visitor moreover had a shilling
back to wait for, during which Milly, from the balcony,
looked down at her, and a mute exchange, but
with smiles and nods, took place between them on
what had occurred in the morning. It was what
Kate had called for, and the tone was thus, almost
by accident, determined for Milly before her friend
came up. What was also, however, determined for
her was, again, yet irrepressibly again, that the
image presented to her, the splendid young woman
who looked so particularly handsome in impatience,
with the fine freedom of her signal, was the peculiar
property of somebody else's vision, that this fine
freedom in short was the fine freedom she showed
Mr. Densher. Just so was how she looked to
him, and just so was how Milly was held by
her—held as by the strange sense of seeing through
that distant person's eyes. It lasted, as usual, the
strange sense, but fifty seconds; yet in so lasting
it produced an effect. It produced in fact more
than one, and we take them in their order. The
first was that it struck our young woman as absurd
to say that a girl's looking so to a man could
possibly be without connections; and the second was
that by the time Kate had got into the room Milly
was in mental possession of the main connection it
must have for herself.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate Croy went straight to the hotel that evening, shortly before dinner. She arrived publicly in a hansom cab, driven very fast, which pulled up under their windows with a near-crash, like it was about to have an accident. Milly was alone in their huge, decorated sitting room. She had been pacing, like a caged bird, through the strange, long, almost ominous delay of the evening, which she secretly enjoyed. At the sound of the cab, one of the French windows was open, and Milly went out onto the balcony overlooking the entrance. She saw Kate getting out of the cab and paying the driver, and caught the look Kate sent up to the balcony. Kate had to wait for her change, during which time Milly looked down at her. They exchanged smiles and nods, without speaking, regarding what had happened that morning. Kate's arrival was what Milly had been waiting for, and the tone of their meeting was set, almost by accident, before Kate even came inside. However, Milly also realized, again, and uncontrollably, that the image of Kate presented to her – the beautiful young woman, looking particularly handsome in her impatience, with a certain confident air – was something someone else saw as well. That same confident air was how she presented herself to Mr. Densher. This was how she looked to him, and Milly was caught up in the experience, feeling as if she was seeing the world through that distant person's eyes. This strange sensation lasted only about fifty seconds, but it still had an effect. It had more than one, in fact, and we'll take them in order. First, it struck Milly as absurd to think that a girl could look at a man that way without there being some kind of connection. Second, by the time Kate came into the room, Milly understood the most important connection it had for *her* own life.</i></p></div>

She produced this commodity on the spot—produced
it, that is, in straight response to Kate's frank
"Well, what?" The inquiry bore of course, with
Kate's eagerness, on the issue of the morning's
scene, the great man's latest wisdom, and it doubtless
affected Milly a little as the cheerful demand for
news is apt to affect troubled spirits when news is
not, in one of the neater forms, prepared for delivery.
She couldn't have said what it was exactly that, on
the instant, determined her; the nearest description
of it would perhaps have been as the more vivid impression
of all her friend took for granted. The
contrast between this free quantity and the maze of
possibilities through which, for hours, she had herself
been picking her way, put on, in short, for the
moment, a grossness that even friendly forms scarce
lightened: it helped forward in fact the revelation
to herself that she absolutely had nothing to tell.
Besides which, certainly, there was something else—an
influence, at the particular juncture, still more
obscure. Kate had lost, on the way upstairs, the
look—<i>the</i> look—that made her young hostess so subtly
think and one of the signs of which was that she
never kept it for many moments at once; yet she
stood there, none the less, so in her bloom and in her
strength, so completely again the "handsome girl"
beyond all others, the "handsome girl" for whom
Milly had at first gratefully taken her, that to meet
her now with the note of the plaintive would amount
somehow to a surrender, to a confession. <i>She</i>
would never in her life be ill; the greatest doctor
would keep her, at the worst, the fewest minutes;
and it was as if she had asked just <i>with</i> all this practical
impeccability for all that was most mortal in
her friend. These things, for Milly, inwardly
danced their dance; but the vibration produced and
the dust kicked up had lasted less than our account
of them. Almost before she knew it she was answering,
and answering, beautifully, with no consciousness
of fraud, only as with a sudden flare of the
famous "will-power" she had heard about, read
about, and which was what her medical adviser had
mainly thrown her back on. "Oh, it's all right.
He's lovely."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She provided the information immediately – that is, in direct response to Kate's blunt question, "Well, what?" The question, naturally, given Kate's eagerness, concerned the morning's event, the great man's latest pronouncements, and it probably affected Milly a little like the cheerful demand for news often affects someone feeling troubled when they don't have any convenient news to share. She couldn't say exactly what made her decide instantly. The closest way to describe it might be that she was more aware of what her friend simply assumed. The difference between this easy openness and the complex possibilities she'd been considering for hours created a sense of bluntness at that moment, which even friendly interactions couldn't entirely soften. In fact, it helped her realize that she had absolutely nothing to say.</i></p><p><i>Besides that, there was definitely something else, a more mysterious influence at that moment. Kate had lost that certain look on the way upstairs – the look that made Milly think so subtly, a look she never held for very long. Yet, Kate still stood there, so vibrant and strong, so completely the "beautiful girl" above all others, the "beautiful girl" Milly had initially been grateful for. To respond with complaints now would be like giving up, like admitting something. Kate would never be sick; the best doctor would only have to deal with her for a short time. And it was as if she'd asked, with her perfect health, for everything most vulnerable in her friend.</i></p><p><i>These thoughts danced around in Milly's mind, but the disturbance they caused and the confusion they stirred didn't last long. Almost before she knew it, she was answering, and answering beautifully, without feeling like she was lying, but instead, with a sudden surge of the famous "willpower" she had heard and read about, and which her doctor had mostly told her to rely on.
