<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Milly is waiting for a visit from her doctor, Sir Luke Strett, and has decided to allow him free access to her companion, Susan Shepherd.</p><p>The narrative focuses on an evening a few days before their departure from London. Milly, Susan, Mrs. Lowder, and Kate Croy are gathered at a hotel after dinner. It is decided that Mrs. Lowder and Susan will go on to a party, while Kate will stay behind with Milly.</p><p>After Susan leaves the room to get a shawl and Kate steps out onto a balcony, Mrs. Lowder asks Milly to mention a Mr. Densher to Kate, to find out if he has returned to London. Mrs. Lowder states that she worries he is bothering Kate, who she claims does not care for him. She explains that she cannot ask Kate herself because they never speak of him.</p><p>Milly questions this approach, noting that she has never mentioned knowing Mr. Densher to Kate before. They discuss the potential awkwardness of her raising the topic now. Milly asks if Mrs. Lowder likes Mr. Densher, and Mrs. Lowder says she does. Milly confirms that she met him in New York. The conversation continues with Milly raising further difficulties, such as what she should tell Kate about why she is asking. Finally, Milly asks if Mr. Densher has been writing to Kate, which Mrs. Lowder says is what she wants to know.</p><p>Just as Milly asks Mrs. Lowder if she believes Mr. Densher is with Kate, Susan returns to the room and Kate reappears in the window. Mrs. Lowder says "Hush!" and then leaves with Susan for the party.</p><p>Milly is left with Kate, who remains standing in the window. Milly looks at Kate and, without a word being spoken, understands that Mr. Densher has returned to London.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly**</li>
Milly is initially presented as a woman who has reached a state of grim resolution. Facing a limited number of "hours," she feels "enviably strong" and has a clear plan for an upcoming doctor's visit. She views the sympathy of others with a cynical, self-deprecating humor, labeling herself "gross, greedy, ravenous." Her situation shifts dramatically when Mrs. Lowder confronts her. This external pressure forces her out of her detached state, revealing a deep, hidden vulnerability concerning Mr. Densher. Her composure becomes a performance, requiring her to "smile hard" and carefully choose her words, one of which costs her more than any she has ever spoken. By the end of the scene, her perception has sharpened to the point where she can understand a complex truth simply by observing Kate's posture.
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
Mrs. Lowder is presented as a powerful and calculating social strategist. She operates with "rich glibness" and has "fine onyx eyes" that do not blink, signifying her unreadable and determined nature. She initiates the scene's central conflict by attempting to use Milly as a tool to extract information about her niece. She frames her manipulative inquiry as a matter of concern for Kate and Mr. Densher, but her primary motivation is to enforce her own "views." When her initial approach is questioned, she shifts tactics from impatience to a disingenuous show of pity and concern, revealing her skill as a manipulator.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Kate is presented almost entirely from the outside, as an object of discussion and observation. Initially, she is a silent, enigmatic figure hovering on a balcony. Mrs. Lowder characterizes her as a "proud young woman" who may be secretly defying her. Kate's situation shifts in the final moments as she moves from being the subject of the conversation to its unspoken resolution. Her mere presence, "handsome and upright" with "conscious eyes," is immediately interpreted by Milly as confirmation that Mr. Densher has returned. She communicates this pivotal fact without uttering a single word.
<li>*Susan Shepherd (Mrs. Stringham)**</li></ul>
Susan is presented as a benevolent but secondary figure, a companion used by others as a social substitute. Milly is pleased to "put people off with her," and Mrs. Lowder dismisses her as "better than nothing." Her situation is static; she serves primarily as a pawn whose departure and return frame the central, private conversation between Milly and Mrs. Lowder.

<p>
Milly indeed at last couldn't say; so that she had
really for the time brought it along to the point so
oddly marked for her by her visitor's arrival, the
truth that she was enviably strong. She carried this
out, from that evening, for each hour still left her,
and the more easily perhaps that the hours were now
narrowly numbered. All she actually waited for
was Sir Luke Strett's promised visit; as to her proceeding
on which, however, her mind was quite made
up. Since he wanted to get at Susie he should have
the freest access, and then perhaps he would see how
he liked it. What was between <i>them</i> they might
settle as between them, and any pressure it should lift
from her own spirit they were at liberty to convert
to their use. If the dear man wished to fire Susan
Shepherd with a still higher ideal, he would only
after all, at the worst, have Susan on his hands. If
devotion, in a word, was what it would come up for
the interested pair to organise, she was herself ready
to consume it as the dressed and served dish. He
had talked to her of her "appetite" her account of
which, she felt, must have been vague. But for devotion,
she could now see, this appetite would be of
the best. Gross, greedy, ravenous—these were
doubtless the proper names for her: she was at all
events resigned in advance to the machinations of
sympathy. The day that followed her lonely excursion
was to be the last but two or three of their stay
in London; and the evening of that day practically
ranked for them as, in the matter of outside relations,
the last of all. People were by this time quite scattered,
and many of those who had so liberally manifested
in calls, in cards, in evident sincerity about
visits, later on, over the land, had positively passed
in music out of sight; whether as members, these
latter, more especially, of Mrs. Lowder's immediate
circle or as members of Lord Mark's—our friends
being by this time able to make the distinction. The
general pitch had thus, decidedly, dropped, and the
occasions still to be dealt with were special and few.
One of these, for Milly, announced itself as the doctor's
call already mentioned, as to which she had now
had a note from him: the single other, of importance,
was their appointed leave-taking—for the
shortest separation—in respect to Mrs. Lowder and
Kate. The aunt and the niece were to dine with
them alone, intimately and easily—as easily as
should be consistent with the question of their afterwards
going on together to some absurdly belated
party, at which they had had it from Aunt Maud that
they would do well to show. Sir Luke was to make
his appearance on the morrow of this, and in respect
to that complication Milly had already her plan.
</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly truly couldn't say anything more. She had, in a way, brought things to a head at the very moment her visitor arrived, highlighting the truth that she was remarkably resilient. From that evening onward, she maintained this composure with each passing hour, perhaps made easier because her time was now limited. She was simply waiting for Sir Luke Strett's promised visit, and she'd already made up her mind about how to handle it. Since he wanted to pursue Susie, he would have complete access, and then maybe he'd see how he liked it. Whatever was between them, they could sort out amongst themselves, and any burden it lifted from her, they were welcome to use. If he wanted to fill Susan Shepherd with an even more passionate ideal, he would only, at worst, have Susan to deal with. If they were going to organize devotion, she was prepared to embrace it fully, like a prepared and served meal. He had mentioned her "appetite," which she felt she had described vaguely. But for devotion, she now realized, this appetite would be at its best. Intense, greedy, insatiable – those were probably the right words for her; she was prepared for the manipulations of empathy. The day after her solitary outing would be one of their last two or three days in London; and the evening of that day was essentially the end of their social life. People had mostly dispersed by now, and many of those who had been so generous with their calls, cards, and apparent eagerness for future visits had completely vanished, especially those in Mrs. Lowder's circle, and also those in Lord Mark's – our friends could now tell the difference. Social activity had declined, and the remaining events were special and few. One of these, for Milly, was the doctor's visit, about which she'd received a note; the other important event was their farewell visit to Mrs. Lowder and Kate. The aunt and niece were to have a private dinner with them, as relaxed as possible, given the question of whether they would all attend a ridiculously late party, which Aunt Maud had advised them to attend. Sir Luke was due the next day, and Milly already had a plan for that situation.</i></p></div>

<p>
The night was, at all events, hot and stale, and it
was late enough by the time the four ladies had been
gathered in, for their small session, at the hotel,
where the windows were still open to the high balconies
and the flames of the candles, behind the pink
shades—disposed as for the vigil of watchers—were
motionless in the air in which the season lay dead.
What was presently settled among them was that
Milly, who betrayed on this occasion a preference
more marked than usual, should not hold herself
obliged to climb that evening the social stair, however
it might stretch to meet her, and that, Mrs.
Lowder and Mrs. Stringham facing the ordeal together,
Kate Croy should remain with her and await
their return. It was a pleasure to Milly, ever, to
send Susan Shepherd forth; she saw her go with
complacency, liked, as it were, to put people off with
her, and noted with satisfaction, when she so moved
to the carriage, the further denudation—a markedly
ebbing tide—of her little benevolent back. If it
wasn't quite Aunt Maud's ideal, moreover, to take
out the new American girl's funny friend instead of
the new American girl herself, nothing could better
indicate the range of that lady's merit than the spirit
in which—as at the present hour for instance—she
made the best of the minor advantage. And she did
this with a broad, cheerful absence of illusion; she
did it—confessing even as much to poor Susie—because,
frankly, she <i>was</i> good-natured. When Mrs.
Stringham observed that her own light was too abjectly
borrowed and that it was as a link alone,
fortunately not missing, that she was valued, Aunt
Maud concurred to the extent of the remark: "Well,
my dear, you're better than nothing." To-night,
furthermore, it came up for Milly that Aunt Maud
had something particular in mind. Mrs. Stringham,
before adjourning with her, had gone off for
some shawl or other accessory, and Kate, as if a little
impatient for their withdrawal, had wandered out
to the balcony, where she hovered, for the time, unseen,
though with scarce more to look at than the
dim London stars and the cruder glow, up the street,
on a corner, of a small public-house, in front of
which a fagged cab-horse was thrown into relief.
Mrs. Lowder made use of the moment: Milly felt
as soon as she had spoken that what she was doing
was somehow for use.

The windows were still open to the balconies, and the candlelight behind the pink lampshades – arranged as if for a vigil – didn't flicker in the still air.</i></p><p><i>What they decided was that Milly, who showed a stronger preference than usual, wouldn't have to go out that evening. She wouldn't be obligated to navigate the social scene, no matter how much effort it took. Instead, Mrs. Lowder and Mrs. Stringham would go together, and Kate Croy would stay behind with Milly and wait for them to return. Milly always enjoyed sending Susan Shepherd out on these social missions. She watched her go with contentment, as if she liked using Susan to deflect attention, and noticed with satisfaction how Susan’s back receded from view as she got into the carriage.</i></p><p><i>Furthermore, it wasn’t exactly Aunt Maud’s first choice to take the new American girl's “funny friend” (Mrs. Stringham) out instead of the American girl herself. However, nothing demonstrated Aunt Maud’s admirable qualities more than her ability to make the best of a secondary role. She did this without any illusions; she did it – she even admitted as much to poor Susan – because she was, frankly, good-natured. When Mrs. Stringham remarked that her own importance was borrowed and that she was only valued as a useful connection, Aunt Maud agreed: "Well, darling, you're better than nothing."</i></p><p><i>Tonight, it also occurred to Milly that Aunt Maud had something specific in mind. Mrs. Stringham had stepped away to retrieve a shawl or other accessory before leaving with Aunt Maud, and Kate, seeming a little eager for them to leave, had gone out to the balcony. She stayed there, unseen for the moment, with little to look at except the faint London stars and the harsh glow from a pub on a nearby corner, which illuminated a tired cab horse.</i></p><p><i>Mrs. Lowder took advantage of the opportunity to speak. As soon as she began, Milly felt that whatever Mrs. Lowder was saying was meant to be used for a specific purpose.</i></p></div>

"Dear Susan tells me that you saw, in America,
Mr. Densher—whom I've never till now, as you may
have noticed, asked you about. But do you mind at
last, in connection with him, doing something for
me?" She had lowered her fine voice to a depth,
though speaking with all her rich glibness; and
Milly, after a small sharpness of surprise, was already
guessing the sense of her appeal. "Will you
name him, in any way you like, to <i>her"</i>—and Aunt
Maud gave a nod at the window; "so that you may
perhaps find out whether he's back?"

Ever so many things, for Milly, fell into line at
this; it was a wonder, she afterwards thought, that
she could be conscious of so many at once. She
smiled hard, however, for them all. "But I don't
know that it's important to me to 'find out.'" The
array of things was further swollen, however, even
as she said this, by its striking her as too much to
say. She therefore tried as quickly to say less.
"Except you mean, of course, that it's important to
<i>you."</i> She fancied Aunt Maud was looking at her
almost as hard as she was herself smiling, and that
gave her another impulse. "You know I never
<i>have</i> yet named him to her; so that if I should break
out now——"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>So many things suddenly made sense to Milly because of this. Later, she was amazed she could understand so much at once.

However, the list of things kept growing, even as she said that, because it struck her as too much to say. So, she tried to say less, quickly. "Unless, of course, you mean it's important to *you*." She felt like Aunt Maud was staring at her as intently as she was smiling, and that prompted another thought. "You know I haven't mentioned him to her yet, so if I were to just blurt it out now—"</i></p></div>

"Well," said Aunt Maud, whose fine onyx eyes
failed to blink, even though Milly's questions might
have been taken as drawing her rather further than
she had originally meant to go—"well, Kate is thoroughly
aware of my views for her, and that I take
her being with me, at present, in the way she is with
me, if you know what I mean, as a loyal assent to
them. Therefore as my views don't happen to provide
a place, at all, for Mr. Densher, much, in a manner,
as I like him"—therefore, therefore in short

Milly hesitated, for the question was somehow as
the sudden point of something sharp on a nerve that
winced. She just caught her breath, but she had
ground for joy afterwards, she felt, in not really
having failed to choose with quickness sufficient, out
of fifteen possible answers, the one that would best
serve her. She was then almost proud, as well, that
she had cheerfully smiled. "I did—three times—in
New York." So came and went for her, in these
simple words, the speech that was to figure for her,
later on, that night, as the one she had ever uttered
that cost her most. She was to lie awake, at all
events, half the night, for the gladness of not having
taken any line so really inferior as the denial of a
happy impression.

But ah, the inquiry had only to be made to bring
the rare colour with fine inconsequence, to her face.
"Not, really, the least little bit!" And, quickly
feeling the need to abound in this sense, she was on
the point, to cut short, of declaring that she cared,
after all, no scrap how much she obliged. Only she
felt at this instant too the intervention of still other
things. Mrs. Lowder was, in the first place, already
beforehand, already affected as by the sudden vision
of her having herself pushed too far. Milly could
never judge from her face of her uppermost motive—it
was so little, in its hard, smooth sheen, that kind
of human countenance. She looked hard when she
spoke fair; the only thing was that when she spoke
hard she likewise didn't look soft. Something, none
the less, had arisen in her now—a full appreciable
tide, entering by the rupture of some bar. She announced
that if what she had asked was to prove in
the least a bore her young friend was not to dream
of it; making her young friend at the same time, by
the change in her tone, dream on the spot more profusely.
She spoke with a belated light, Milly could
apprehend—she could always apprehend—from
pity; and the result of that perception, for the girl,
was singular: it proved to her as quickly that Kate,
keeping her secret, had been straight with her.
From Kate distinctly then, as to why she was to be
pitied, Aunt Maud knew nothing, and was thereby
simply putting in evidence the fine side of her own
character. This fine side was that she could almost
at any hour, by a kindled preference or a diverted
energy, glow for another interest than her own.
She exclaimed as well, at this moment, that Milly
must have been thinking, round the case, much more
than she had supposed; and this remark could, at
once, affect the girl as sharply as any other form of
the charge of weakness. It was what everyone, if
she didn't look out, would soon be saying—"There's
something the matter with you!" What one was
therefore one's self concerned immediately to establish
was that there was nothing at all. "I shall like
to help you; I shall like, so far as that goes, to help
Kate herself," she made such haste as she could to
declare; her eyes wandering meanwhile across the
width of the room to that dusk of the balcony in
which their companion perhaps a little unaccountably
lingered. She suggested hereby her impatience
to begin; she almost overtly wondered at the length
of the opportunity this friend was giving them—referring
it, however, so far as words went, to the
other friend, breaking off with an amused: "How
tremendously Susie must be beautifying!"
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>But just asking the question immediately brought a rosy flush to her face, a seemingly insignificant reaction. "Not at all!" And quickly feeling the need to emphasize this, she was about to declare that she didn't care at all how much she was inconveniencing them. But at that moment, she also felt other things influencing her. First of all, Mrs. Lowder seemed to have already anticipated her, reacting as though she had suddenly realized she'd gone too far. Milly could never tell from her expression what Mrs. Lowder was really thinking—her hard, smooth face revealed so little of her true emotions. She looked severe even when she was being pleasant; the only thing was that she didn't soften her expression when she spoke harshly either. Still, something was happening in her now—a significant emotional shift, like a dam breaking. She said that if what she had asked was even slightly bothersome, Milly shouldn't even consider it; and, by the change in her tone, made her young friend suddenly consider it even more.</i></p><p><i>Milly could sense a delayed understanding in Kate's words—she always could—and it came from pity. This perception had a strange effect on Milly: it quickly proved to her that Kate, despite keeping a secret, had been honest with her. From Kate, then, Aunt Maud knew nothing about why Milly should be pitied, and was merely demonstrating the good side of her own nature. This good side was that she could almost always, through a strong preference or a redirected focus, show genuine interest in something other than herself.</i></p><p><i>She also exclaimed at that moment that Milly must have been thinking about the situation more than she had realized; and this remark could instantly sting Milly, like any accusation of weakness. It was what everyone, if she wasn't careful, would soon be saying—"There's something wrong with you!" So what she immediately needed to establish was that there was nothing wrong at all. "I'd like to help you; I'd like to help Kate herself," she quickly declared; her eyes drifting across the room to the shadowy balcony where their companion was perhaps a little inexplicably lingering. She was subtly indicating her eagerness to get started; she almost openly wondered why their friend was taking so long—referring to it, though, through words, to the other friend, and concluding with an amused, "How wonderfully Susie must be making herself beautiful!"</i></p></div>

Aunt Maud took it in—took in, that is, everything
of the tone that she just wanted her not to; and the
result for some seconds, was but to make their eyes
meet in silence. Mrs. Stringham had rejoined them
and was asking if Kate had gone—an inquiry at once
answered by this young lady's reappearance. They
saw her again in the open window, where, looking
at them, she had paused—producing thus, on Aunt
Maud's part, almost too impressive a "Hush!"
Mrs. Lowder indeed, without loss of time, smothered
any danger in a sweeping retreat with Susie;
but Milly's words to her, just uttered, about dealing
with her niece directly, struck our young woman as
already recoiling on herself. Directness, however
evaded, would be, fully, for <i>her;</i> nothing in fact
would ever have been for her so direct as the evasion.
Kate had remained in the window, very handsome
and upright, the outer dark framing in a highly
favourable way her summery simplicities and lightnesses
of dress. Milly had, given the relation of
space, no real fear she had heard their talk; only she
hovered there as with conscious eyes and some added
advantage. Then indeed, with small delay, her
friend sufficiently saw. The conscious eyes, the
added advantage were but those she had now always
at command—those proper to the person Milly knew
as known to Merton Densher. It was for several
seconds again as if the <i>total</i> of her identity had been
that of the person known to him—a determination
having for result another sharpness of its own.
Kate had positively but to be there just as she was to
tell her he had come back. It seemed to pass between
them, in fine, without a word, that he was in
London, that he was perhaps only round the corner;
and surely therefore no dealing of Milly's with her
would yet have been so direct.
