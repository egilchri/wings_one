<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Two ladies, Mrs. Stringham and Milly Theale, travel together through the Brünig pass in Switzerland. They had previously met in Boston, after which Mrs. Stringham visited Milly in New York. Following the visit, Milly sent a telegram proposing an immediate, unconditional trip to Europe, which Mrs. Stringham accepted. They traveled by sea to Naples and then made their way through Italy and over the Alps.</p><p>While on the Brünig, they stop for lunch and agree to prolong their stay. Milly leaves Mrs. Stringham to make the arrangements for lodging and their carriage. Milly then takes a book and strolls off. After an hour, Mrs. Stringham goes to find her. She follows a path up a hillside and past some chalets, where an old woman indicates the direction Milly took. Mrs. Stringham continues on and finds Milly's book lying on a rock.</p><p>From her position, she sees Milly sitting on a rock slab at the edge of a precipice. Mrs. Stringham watches her for several minutes without revealing her presence. She then quietly withdraws. After waiting for some time, she returns to the path where the book is, writes "à bientôt!" on its cover with a pencil, and goes back to the inn. Late in the afternoon, Milly reappears.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study.</p><p>### Mrs. Susan Stringham
</p><ul><li>**Initial Presentation:** Mrs. Stringham is a middle-aged, childless New England widow and a writer of modest reputation. She presents herself as a "woman of the world" due to a European education in her youth, and she leads a structured, intellectually-inclined life in Boston. She is self-aware, observant, and prone to "shy conceits," living a life more of refined observation than of direct, passionate experience.</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically upon meeting Milly Theale. Her quiet, ordered life is completely upended. She renounces her own ambitions to become Milly’s devoted companion, shifting her role from an independent woman to a self-appointed "confidant." This new relationship forces her into a state of constant, "secretive" observation and analysis, which she recognizes is contrary to her nature. Her perception culminates in a moment of terror on the mountain, which then resolves into a "revelation": she no longer sees Milly as merely restless but as a grand figure confronting a profound and complex destiny.</li><p>### Milly Theale
</p><li>**Initial Presentation:** Milly is presented almost exclusively through Mrs. Stringham’s admiring and bewildered eyes. She is a young, strikingly unconventional New Yorker, described as "slim, pale, delicately haggard" with exceptional red hair and dressed in mourning. She is an orphan of immense wealth who has suffered numerous bereavements. Characterized by a "charming, ambiguous oddity," she is at once restlessly impatient, inexplicably sad, and charmingly gay. To Mrs. Stringham, she is a "princess" who seems tragically inexperienced and "starved for culture."</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** The narrative begins with Milly successfully undertaking a European tour against advice. Her situation, however, shifts from that of a wealthy, melancholy tourist to something far more serious. Her solitary contemplation on a dangerous cliff edge transforms her from a figure of romantic restlessness into one of immense gravity. The ambiguity surrounding her "unpacified state" sharpens into the impression that she is consciously facing "the whole assault of life," and is reserved for a "complicated passage" rather than a simple resolution.</li></ul>

The two ladies who, in advance of the Swiss
season, had been warned that their design
was unconsidered, that the passes would not be
clear, nor the air mild, nor the inns open—the two
ladies who, characteristically, had braved a good
deal of possibly interested remonstrance were finding
themselves, as their adventure turned out, wonderfully
sustained. It was the judgment of the
head-waiters and other functionaries on the Italian
lakes that approved itself now as interested; they
themselves had been conscious of impatiences, of
bolder dreams—at least the younger had; so that
one of the things they made out together—making
out as they did an endless variety—was that in
those operatic palaces of the Villa d'Este, of Cadenabbia,
of Pallanza and Stresa, lone women, however
reinforced by a travelling-library of instructive
volumes, were apt to be beguiled and undone.
Their flights of fancy moreover had been modest;
they had for instance risked nothing vital in hoping
to make their way by the Brünig. They were
making it in fact happily enough as we meet them,
and were only wishing that, for the wondrous
beauty of the early high-climbing spring, it might
have been longer and the places to pause and rest
more numerous.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The two women, who had been warned before their trip to Switzerland that their plans were ill-advised, that the mountain passes wouldn't be clear, the weather wouldn't be mild, and the inns wouldn't be open—the two women who, as usual, had ignored a lot of potentially helpful advice—were finding their adventure to be surprisingly enjoyable. The negative opinions of the head waiters and staff at the Italian lakes were now proving to be self-serving; the women suspected they’d been jealous, had bigger ambitions of their own—at least the younger one had. One of the things they discussed together, among many other topics, was how single women, even those armed with a traveling library of educational books, were often deceived and taken advantage of in the opulent settings of the Villa d'Este, Cadenabbia, Pallanza, and Stresa. Their goals had been relatively simple; for example, they hadn't risked anything serious by hoping to travel through the Brünig Pass. They were actually having a great time as we find them, and only wished that the stunning beauty of the early spring in the mountains could have lasted longer, and that there had been more places to stop and rest.</i></p></div>

Such at least had been the intimated attitude of
Mrs. Stringham, the elder of the companions, who
had her own view of the impatiences of the
younger, to which, however, she offered an opposition
but of the most circuitous. She moved, the
admirable Mrs. Stringham, in a fine cloud of observation
and suspicion; she was in the position,
as she believed, of knowing much more about Milly
Theale than Milly herself knew, and yet of having
to darken her knowledge as well as make it active.
The woman in the world least formed by nature, as
she was quite aware, for duplicities and labyrinths,
she found herself dedicated to personal subtlety by
a new set of circumstances, above all by a new personal
relation; had now in fact to recognise that an
education in the occult—she could scarce say what
to call it—had begun for her the day she left New
York with Mildred. She had come on from Boston
for that purpose; had seen little of the girl—or
rather had seen her but briefly, for Mrs. Stringham,
when she saw anything at all, saw much, saw
everything—before accepting her proposal; and
had accordingly placed herself, by her act, in a boat
that she more and more estimated as, humanly
speaking, of the biggest, though likewise, no
doubt, in many ways, by reason of its size, of the
safest. In Boston, the winter before, the young
lady in whom we are interested had, on the spot,
deeply, yet almost tacitly, appealed to her, dropped
into her mind the shy conceit of some assistance,
some devotion to render. Mrs. Stringham's little
life had often been visited by shy conceits—secret
dreams that had fluttered their hour between its
narrow walls without, for any great part, so much
as mustering courage to look out of its rather dim
windows. But this imagination—the fancy of a
possible link with the remarkable young thing from
New York—<i>had</i> mustered courage: had perched,
on the instant, at the clearest look-out it could find,
and might be said to have remained there till, only
a few months later, it had caught, in surprise and
joy, the unmistakable flash of a signal.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>At least, that's what Mrs. Stringham, the older of the two, seemed to think. She had her own opinions about the younger woman's impatience, but she only resisted it in very subtle ways. Mrs. Stringham was a keen observer, always suspicious; she believed she knew far more about Milly Theale than Milly knew herself, yet she had to keep her knowledge hidden and also use it carefully. Though she knew she wasn't naturally inclined towards deceit or complicated schemes, she found herself forced to be subtly manipulative because of a new situation, especially a new relationship. She realized that her education in the mysterious – she didn't know how else to describe it – had started the day she left New York with Mildred. She'd come from Boston specifically for that reason, having barely met the girl – or rather, having only known her briefly, because when Mrs. Stringham saw something, she saw everything – before accepting her offer. By doing so, she'd put herself in a situation she increasingly saw as enormously important, although also, because of its significance, probably quite safe. The previous winter in Boston, the young woman we're interested in had immediately and quietly appealed to her, planting in her mind the hopeful idea of offering some help, some devotion. Mrs. Stringham's life had often been filled with such hopes – secret dreams that had briefly flourished in her limited life, rarely daring to look outside her rather dull existence. But this particular idea – the fantasy of a connection with the extraordinary young woman from New York – had been bolder: it had immediately positioned itself at the best vantage point it could find and could be said to have stayed there until, just a few months later, it had been surprised and delighted by a clear sign of confirmation.</i></p></div>

Milly Theale had Boston friends, such as they
were, and of recent making; and it was understood
that her visit to them—a visit that was not to be
meagre—had been undertaken, after a series of
bereavements, in the interest of the particular peace
that New York could not give. It was recognised,
liberally enough, that there were many things—perhaps
even too many—New York <i>could</i> give;
but this was felt to make no difference in the constant
fact that what you had most to do, under the
discipline of life, or of death, was really to feel your
situation as grave. Boston could help you to
that as nothing else could, and it had extended
to Milly, by every presumption, some such measure
of assistance. Mrs. Stringham was never to forget—for
the moment had not faded, nor the infinitely
fine vibration it set up in any degree ceased—her
own first sight of the striking apparition, then unheralded
and unexplained: the slim, constantly
pale, delicately haggard, anomalously, agreeably
angular young person, of not more than two-and-twenty
in spite of her marks, whose hair was some
how exceptionally red even for the real thing,
which it innocently confessed to being, and whose
clothes were remarkably black even for robes of
mourning, which was the meaning they expressed.
It was New York mourning, it was New York hair,
it was a New York history, confused as yet, but
multitudinous, of the loss of parents, brothers, sisters,
almost every human appendage, all on a scale
and with a sweep that had required the greater stage;
it was a New York legend of affecting, of romantic
isolation, and, beyond everything, it was by most accounts,
in respect to the mass of money so piled on
the girl's back, a set of New York possibilities. She
was alone, she was stricken, she was rich, and, in
particular, she was strange—a combination in itself
of a nature to engage Mrs. Stringham's attention.
But it was the strangeness that most determined
our good lady's sympathy, convinced as she was
that it was much greater than any one else—any
one but the sole Susan Stringham—supposed.
Susan privately settled it that Boston was not in
the least seeing her, was only occupied with her
seeing Boston, and that any assumed affinity between
the two characters was delusive and vain.
She was seeing her, and she had quite the deepest
moment of her life in now obeying the instinct to
conceal the vision. She couldn't explain it—no one
would understand. They would say clever Boston
things—Mrs. Stringham was from Burlington, Vermont,
which she boldly upheld as the real heart of
New England, Boston being "too far south"—but
they would only darken counsel.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly Theale had recently made some friends in Boston, and it was understood that her visit there—a visit that would be well-funded—was intended to find a sense of peace that New York couldn't offer, after a series of personal tragedies. It was generally accepted that New York had many opportunities, maybe even too many, but that didn't change the fact that the most important thing to do in life, or in the face of death, was to accept the seriousness of your situation. Boston could help with that like nothing else, and it was believed that Milly was receiving that kind of support. Mrs. Stringham would never forget the moment she first saw this striking figure, who was, at the time, unexpected and unexplained. It was the slim, consistently pale, subtly worn, and unusually attractive young woman, maybe no older than twenty-two despite her hardship, whose hair was an especially vibrant red, even for natural red hair, and whose clothing was exceptionally black, as in mourning clothes.</i></p><p><i>It was New York mourning, New York hair, a New York story, still unclear but filled with losses: parents, siblings, almost every close family member, all on a scale that demanded a larger setting. It was a New York legend of moving, romantic isolation, and, most importantly, according to most people, given the vast wealth the girl possessed, it was a collection of New York possibilities. She was alone, grieving, wealthy, and, in particular, peculiar – a combination that immediately captured Mrs. Stringham's attention. But it was the strangeness that most strongly drew our kind Mrs. Stringham's sympathy, as she was convinced that Milly's strangeness was much greater than anyone else—anyone but Susan Stringham herself—realized.</i></p><p><i>Privately, Susan decided that Boston wasn't really *seeing* Milly at all. Boston was just preoccupied with Milly observing it, and any perceived connection between the two was false and pointless. Susan, on the other hand, *was* seeing her, and had her most significant moment in her life by obeying the instinct to hide what she saw. She couldn't explain it – no one would understand. They would make their clever Boston remarks—Mrs. Stringham was from Burlington, Vermont, which she proudly claimed was the true heart of New England, Boston being "too far south"—but they would only cloud the truth.</i></p></div>

There could be no better proof, than this quick
intellectual split, of the impression made on our
friend, who shone, herself, she was well aware, with
but the reflected light of the admirable city. She
too had had her discipline, but it had not made
her striking; it had been prosaically usual, though
doubtless a decent dose; and had only made her
usual to match it—usual, that is, as Boston went.
She had lost first her husband, and then her mother,
with whom, on her husband's death, she had lived
again; so that now, childless, she was but more
sharply single than before. But she sat rather
coldly light, having, as she called it, enough to live
on—so far, that is, as she lived by bread alone:
how little indeed she was regularly content with that
diet appeared from the name she had made—Susan
Shepherd Stringham—as a contributor to the best
magazines. She wrote short stories, and she fondly
believed she had her "note," the art of showing
New England without showing it wholly in the
kitchen. She had not herself been brought up in
the kitchen; she knew others who had not; and to
speak for them had thus become with her a literary
mission. To <i>be</i> in truth literary had ever been her
dearest thought, the thought that kept her bright
little nippers perpetually in position. There were
masters, models, celebrities, mainly foreign, whom
she finely accounted so and in whose light she ingeniously
laboured; there were others whom, however
chattered about, she ranked with the inane, for
she was full of discrimination; but all categories
failed her—they ceased at least to signify—as soon
as she found herself in presence of the real thing,
the romantic life itself. That was what she saw in
Mildred—what positively made her hand a while
tremble too much for the pen. She had had, it
seemed to her, a revelation—such as even New
England refined and grammatical couldn't give;
and, all made up as she was of small neat memories
and ingenuities, little industries and ambitions,
mixed with something moral, personal, that was still
more intensely responsive, she felt her new friend
would have done her an ill turn if their friendship
shouldn't develop, and yet that nothing would be
left of anything else if it should. It was for the surrender
of everything else that she was, however,
quite prepared, and while she went about her usual
Boston business with her usual Boston probity she
was really all the while holding herself. She wore
her "handsome" felt hat, so Tyrolese, yet some
how, though feathered from the eagle's wing, so
truly domestic, with the same straightness and security;
she attached her fur boa with the same
honest precautions; she preserved her balance on
the ice-slopes with the same practised skill; she
opened, each evening, her "Transcript" with the
same interfusion of suspense and resignation; she
attended her almost daily concert with the same
expenditure of patience and the same economy of
passion; she flitted in and out of the Public Library
with the air of conscientiously returning or bravely
carrying off in her pocket the key of knowledge itself;
and finally—it was what she most did—she
watched the thin trickle of a fictive "love-interest"
through that somewhat serpentine channel, in the
magazines, which she mainly managed to keep clear
for it. But the real thing, all the while, was elsewhere;
the real thing had gone back to New York,
leaving behind it the two unsolved questions, quite
distinct, of why it <i>was</i> real, and whether she should
ever be so near it again.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The fact that our friend immediately changed her mind so quickly proved how impressed she was. She knew she was only shining because of the great city that she lived in. She had also followed a strict routine, but it hadn't made her stand out. Her life had been ordinary, but acceptable, which was typical for someone from Boston. She had lost her husband first, and then her mother, with whom she had lived after her husband died. Now, without children, she felt even more alone than before. However, she was financially comfortable, as she put it. She was living on enough money to survive on, but her true desires were evident from her pen name, Susan Shepherd Stringham, and her contributions to the most popular magazines. She wrote short stories, and she was convinced she had her own "voice," which involved portraying New England life without focusing solely on the kitchen. She herself hadn't grown up in a kitchen, and she knew others who hadn't either. So, she felt it was her literary duty to speak for them. To be a true writer had always been her greatest aspiration, and it kept her small, meticulous mind constantly focused. There were influential figures, role models, and celebrities, mostly from other countries, whom she greatly admired and whose techniques she studied. There were others, however, who she considered unimportant, regardless of their popularity, because she was good at recognizing quality. But all categories became meaningless as soon as she encountered something authentic, the exciting experience of real life. That was what she saw in Mildred—it was so powerful that her hand shook too much to write for a while. It seemed to her like a revelation, something that even the refined, intellectual world of New England couldn't provide. She was made up of neat memories, clever ideas, small projects, and ambitions. These were mixed with something moral and personal that was even more deeply felt. She thought her new friendship would be a disservice if it didn't develop, and yet she felt that everything else in her life would be lost if it did. She was ready to give up everything else, and while she went about her usual Boston routine with her usual Boston integrity, she was really just biding her time. She wore her "handsome" felt hat, which looked Tyrolean, yet somehow, despite being decorated with feathers, it seemed incredibly practical. She always tied her fur boa with the same caution. She kept her balance on the icy sidewalks with the same practiced skill. She opened her newspaper each evening with the same mixture of anticipation and acceptance. She attended her almost daily concert with the same display of patience and the same restraint of emotion. She went in and out of the public library as if she were conscientiously returning or bravely carrying off the key to knowledge itself. Finally—and this was what she did most—she watched the thin flow of fictional romance through the somewhat winding path of the magazines, which she mostly managed to keep open for it. But the real experience, meanwhile, was somewhere else. The real thing had returned to New York, leaving behind two unanswered questions, completely separate, about why it was genuine, and whether she would ever experience it again.</i></p></div>

<p>
For the figure to which these questions attached
themselves she had found a convenient description—she
thought of it for herself, always, as that of a
girl with a background. The great reality was in
the fact that, very soon, after but two or three
meetings, the girl with the background, the girl
with the crown of old gold and the mourning that
was not as the mourning of Boston, but at once
more rebellious in its gloom and more frivolous in
its frills, had told her she had never seen any one
like her. They had met thus as opposed curiosities,
and that simple remark of Milly's—if simple it was—became
the most important thing that had ever
happened to her; it deprived the love-interest, for
the time, of actuality and even of pertinence; it
moved her first, in short, in a high degree, to gratitude,
and then to no small compassion. Yet in respect
to this relation at least it was what did prove
the key of knowledge; it lighted up as nothing else
could do the poor young woman's history. That
the potential heiress of all the ages should never
have seen any one like a mere typical subscriber,
after all, to the "Transcript" was a truth that—in
especial as announced with modesty, with humility,
with regret—described a situation. It laid upon
the elder woman, as to the void to be filled, a
weight of responsibility; but in particular it led her
to ask whom poor Mildred <i>had</i> then seen, and what
range of contacts it had taken to produce such
queer surprises. That was really the inquiry that
had ended by clearing the air: the key of knowledge
was felt to click in the lock from the moment
it flashed upon Mrs. Stringham that her friend had
been starved for culture. Culture was what she
herself represented for her, and it was living up to
that principle that would surely prove the great
business. She knew, the clever lady, what the
principle itself represented, and the limits of her
own store; and a certain alarm would have grown
upon her if something else hadn't grown faster.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>For the person this whole thing revolved around, she'd come up with a convenient label – she always thought of her as "the girl with the background." The truly significant thing was that, very quickly, after only a few meetings, this girl, the one with the crown of antique gold and mourning that was different from the usual Boston kind, more rebellious in its sadness and more extravagant in its ornamentation, had told her she’d never met anyone like her. They’d begun their relationship as opposing oddities, and that simple comment from Milly – if simple it was – became the most important thing that had ever happened to her. It made the romantic interest, for the moment, seem unimportant, even irrelevant. It first moved her deeply to gratitude, and then to a good deal of sympathy. Yet, at least concerning this relationship, it actually unlocked understanding; it illuminated the young woman's past in a way nothing else could. The fact that this potential heiress, from a lineage stretching back through the ages, had never seen anyone like a typical "Transcript" reader was a truth that, particularly when expressed with modesty, humility, and regret, defined a situation. It placed a burden of responsibility on the older woman, concerning the emptiness she could fill; but, more specifically, it led her to wonder whom poor Mildred *had* seen, and what kind of encounters had caused such surprising opinions. That was the question that ultimately cleared everything up: the key to understanding clicked into place the moment it dawned on Mrs. Stringham that her friend was starved for "culture."

This was, fortunately for her—and we give it in her
own words—the sense of a harrowing pathos.
That, primarily, was what appealed to her, what
seemed to open the door of romance for her still
wider than any, than a still more reckless, connection
with the "picture-papers." For such was
essentially the point: it was rich, romantic, abysmal,
to have, as was evident, thousands and thousands a
year, to have youth and intelligence and if not
beauty, at least, in equal measure, a high, dim,
charming, ambiguous oddity, which was even better,
and then on top of all to enjoy boundless freedom,
the freedom of the wind in the desert—it was
unspeakably touching to be so equipped and yet to
have been reduced by fortune to little humble-minded
mistakes.

Basically, that was the appeal: it was glamorous, romantic, and devastating to have a fortune, youth, intelligence, and even if not beauty, then at least a strange, subtle, and captivating quality (which was arguably better), plus complete freedom.

It brought our friend's imagination back again
to New York, where aberrations were so possible
in the intellectual sphere, and it in fact caused a
visit she presently paid there to overflow with interest.
As Milly had beautifully invited her, so she
would hold out if she could against the strain of
so much confidence in her mind; and the remarkable
thing was that even at the end of three weeks
she <i>had</i> held out. But by this time her mind had
grown comparatively bold and free; it was dealing
with new quantities, a different proportion altogether—and
that had made for refreshment: she
had accordingly gone home in convenient possession
of her subject. New York was vast, New York
was startling, with strange histories, with wild cosmopolite
backward generations that accounted for
anything; and to have got nearer the luxuriant
tribe of which the rare creature was the final flower,
the immense, extravagant, unregulated cluster, with
free-living ancestors, handsome dead cousins, lurid
uncles, beautiful vanished aunts, persons all busts
and curls, preserved, though so exposed, in the
marble of famous French chisels—all this, to say
nothing of the effect of closer growths of the stem,
was to have had one's small world-space both
crowded and enlarged. Our couple had at all
events effected an exchange; the elder friend had
been as consciously intellectual as possible, and the
younger, abounding in personal revelation, had
been as unconsciously distinguished. This was
poetry—it was also history—Mrs. Stringham
thought, to a finer tune even than Maeterlink and
Pater, than Marbot and Gregorovius. She appointed
occasions for the reading of these authors
with her hostess, rather perhaps than actually
achieved great spans; but what they managed and
what they missed speedily sank for her into the dim
depths of the merely relative, so quickly, so strongly
had she clutched her central clue. All her scruples
and hesitations, all her anxious enthusiasms, had reduced
themselves to a single alarm—the fear that
she really might act on her companion clumsily and
coarsely. She was positively afraid of what she
might do to her, and to avoid that, to avoid it with
piety and passion, to do, rather, nothing at all, to
leave her untouched because no touch one could
apply, however light, however just, however earnest
and anxious, would be half good enough, would be
anything but an ugly smutch upon perfection—this
now imposed itself as a consistent, an inspiring
thought.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It brought our friend's imagination back to New York. In New York, anything felt possible in the world of ideas. This inspired a visit she took there, which turned out to be incredibly interesting. Milly had gracefully invited her, and she had tried to resist the pressure of so much trust placed in her. The surprising thing was that she succeeded for three weeks. But by then, her mind had become more confident and open. It was dealing with new concepts and a completely different perspective, which was refreshing. She ultimately returned home, ready to understand her subject. New York was huge and surprising, filled with strange stories and wild, diverse generations that could explain anything. To get closer to the fascinating group of which this rare person was the ultimate representative—the huge, unrestrained collection with free-spirited ancestors, attractive deceased relatives, scandalous uncles, beautiful deceased aunts, people who were like statues preserved in famous French sculptures—all this, not to mention the impact of more intimate connections, had both filled and expanded her own world.</i></p><p><i>In any case, the two friends had made an exchange: the older friend had been as intellectual and thoughtful as possible, while the younger friend, overflowing with personal revelations, was naturally remarkable.

She planned to read these authors with her hostess, though perhaps she didn't read for very long. But what they did manage to read, and what they missed, quickly became insignificant to her, lost in the realm of relativity. She had grasped her central understanding so quickly and firmly. All her doubts, hesitations, and enthusiastic worries had narrowed down to one fear: that she might act awkwardly and clumsily towards her companion. She was genuinely afraid of what she might do to her. To avoid that, to avoid it with deep respect and passion, to do nothing at all, to leave her untouched because no action, however gentle, however fair, however sincere and worried, would be good enough, would be anything but a blemish on perfection—this had become her driving and inspiring thought.</i></p></div>

Less than a month after the event that had so
determined Mrs. Stringham's attitude—close upon
the heels, that is, of her return from New York—she
was reached by a proposal that brought up for
her the kind of question her delicacy might have
to contend with. Would she start for Europe with
her young friend at the earliest possible date, and
should she be willing to do so without making conditions?
The inquiry was launched by wire; explanations,
in sufficiency, were promised; extreme
urgency was suggested, and a general surrender
invited. It was to the honour of her sincerity that
she made the surrender on the spot, though it was
not perhaps altogether to that of her logic. She
had wanted, very consciously, from the first, to give
something up for her new acquaintance, but she
had now no doubt that she was practically giving
up all. What settled this was the fulness of a particular
impression, the impression that had throughout
more and more supported her and which she
would have uttered so far as she might by saying
that the charm of the creature was positively in the
creature's greatness. She would have been content
so to leave it; unless indeed she had said, more
familiarly, that Mildred was the biggest impression
of her life. That was at all events the biggest account
of her, and none but a big, clearly, would do.
Her situation, as such things were called, was on
the grand scale; but it still was not that. It was
her nature, once for all—a nature that reminded
Mrs. Stringham of the term always used in the newspapers
about the great new steamers, the inordinate
number of "feet of water" they drew; so
that if, in your little boat, you had chosen to hover
and approach, you had but yourself to thank, when
once motion was started, for the way the draught
pulled you. Milly drew the feet of water, and odd
though it might seem that a lonely girl, who was
not robust and who hated sound and show, should
stir the stream like a leviathan, her companion
floated off with the sense of rocking violently at
her side. More than prepared, however, for that
excitement, Mrs. Stringham mainly failed of ease
in respect to her own consistency. To attach herself
for an indefinite time seemed a roundabout
way of holding her hands off. If she wished to be
sure of neither touching nor smutching, the
straighter plan would doubtless have been not to
keep her friend within reach. This in fact she fully
recognised, and with it the degree to which she
desired that the girl should lead her life, a life certain
to be so much finer than that of anybody else.
The difficulty, however, by good fortune, cleared
away as soon as she had further recognised, as she
was speedily able to do, that she, Susan Shepherd—the
name with which Milly for the most part
amused herself—was <i>not</i> anybody else. She had
renounced that character; she had now no life to
lead; and she honestly believed that she was thus
supremely equipped for leading Milly's own. No
other person whatever, she was sure, had to an
equal degree this qualification, and it was really to
assert it that she fondly embarked.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Less than a month after the incident that had profoundly shaped Mrs. Stringham's feelings—shortly after her return from New York—she received a proposition that forced her to confront a question her own sense of propriety might struggle with. Would she depart for Europe with her young friend as soon as possible, and would she be willing to do so without any reservations or demands?</i></p><p><i>The inquiry arrived by telegram; explanations would follow, they promised; the situation was described as extremely urgent, and a complete, unconditional agreement was requested. To her credit, she agreed immediately, though perhaps not entirely based on rational thought. From the beginning, she had consciously wanted to sacrifice something for her new friend, but now she felt she was essentially giving up everything. This decision was cemented by a powerful, recurring feeling, an impression that had increasingly sustained her. She would have explained it by saying that her friend's charm stemmed from her inherent greatness. That would have sufficed, unless she had phrased it more casually, by saying Mildred was the most significant presence in her life. That was, at any rate, the most accurate description, and anything less would simply not do.</i></p><p><i>Her role in this situation, as it was understood, was on a large scale; but that wasn’t quite it. It was her very nature, her fundamental being—a nature that reminded Mrs. Stringham of the phrase often used in the newspapers about the huge new ships, the enormous "feet of water" they drew; so that, if you had decided to approach her in a small boat, you only had yourself to blame, once the ship began to move, for the way the current pulled you along. Milly drew the "feet of water," and, strange as it seemed that a solitary girl, not physically strong and averse to noise and display, should create such a powerful current, her companion felt herself rocking violently alongside.</i></p><p><i>Though she was more than ready for this kind of upheaval, Mrs. Stringham was primarily uneasy about maintaining her own principles. Committing herself for an unspecified period seemed a convoluted way of maintaining distance. If she wanted to ensure she neither interfered nor caused problems, the more straightforward solution would undoubtedly have been to avoid staying close to her friend. In fact, she fully acknowledged this, along with the degree to which she wanted the girl to live her life—a life destined to be far more extraordinary than anyone else's.</i></p><p><i>However, thankfully, the problem resolved itself as soon as she further realized, which she quickly did, that she, Susan Shepherd—the name Milly often playfully used for her—was not just anyone. She had relinquished that role; she now had no life of her own to live; and she genuinely believed that she was, in this way, ideally suited to guide Milly's. She was certain that no one else possessed this qualification to the same degree, and it was primarily to establish this fact that she enthusiastically embarked on this journey.</i></p></div>

Many things, though not in many weeks, had
come and gone since then, and one of the best of
them, doubtless, had been the voyage itself, by
the happy southern course, to the succession of
Mediterranean ports, with the dazzled wind-up at
Naples. Two or three others had preceded this;
incidents, indeed rather lively marks, of their last
fortnight at home, and one of which had determined
on Mrs. Stringham's part a rush to New York, forty-eight
breathless hours there, previous to her final
rally. But the great sustained sea-light had drunk
up the rest of the picture, so that for many days
other questions and other possibilities sounded with
as little effect as a trio of penny whistles might
sound in a Wagner overture. It was the Wagner
overture that practically prevailed, up through Italy,
where Milly had already been, still further up and
across the Alps, which were also partly known to
Mrs. Stringham; only perhaps "taken" to a time
not wholly congruous, hurried in fact on account
of the girl's high restlessness. She had been expected,
she had frankly promised, to be restless—that
was partly why she was "great"—or was a
consequence, at any rate, if not a cause; yet she
had not perhaps altogether announced herself as
straining so hard at the cord. It was familiar, it
was beautiful to Mrs. Stringham that she had arrears
to make up, the chances that had lapsed for
her through the wanton ways of forefathers fond of
Paris, but not of its higher sides, and fond almost
of nothing else; but the vagueness, the openness,
the eagerness without point and the interest without
pause—all a part of the charm of her oddity as
at first presented—had become more striking in
proportion as they triumphed over movement and
change. She had arts and idiosyncrasies of which
no great account could have been given, but which
were a daily grace if you lived with them; such as
the art of being almost tragically impatient and yet
making it as light as air; of being inexplicably sad
and yet making it as clear as noon; of being unmistakably
gay, and yet making it as soft as dusk.
Mrs. Stringham by this time understood everything,
was more than ever confirmed in wonder and
admiration, in her view that it was life enough simply
to feel her companion's feelings; but there were
special keys she had not yet added to her bunch,
impressions that, of a sudden, were apt to affect her
as new.

They’d taken the pleasant southern route, visiting a series of Mediterranean ports, culminating in the dazzling experience in Naples. A couple of other significant events had occurred before this: lively memories of their last two weeks at home. One of these events caused Mrs. Stringham to rush to New York for forty-eight frantic hours before her final travel plans solidified. However, the expansive, sustained beauty of the sea had overshadowed everything else. For a long time, other concerns and possibilities seemed insignificant, like the sound of penny whistles against a Wagner overture. It was, in a way, like the Wagner overture that prevailed, particularly through Italy, where Milly had already been. She had also traveled further into the Alps, which Mrs. Stringham was also familiar with, although maybe not at a time that suited the present, as the travels were hurried due to the girl's high level of anxiety. It was expected and frankly promised that she would be restless—that was partly why she was considered "great"—or, at the very least, a consequence, if not the cause. Yet she hadn't completely revealed how much she was struggling. It was familiar and lovely to Mrs. Stringham that there were experiences to be had, opportunities that had been missed because of her ancestors' love for Paris and not its more sophisticated aspects, or their passion for anything else. But the vagueness, the openness, the fervent but directionless eagerness, and the continuous interest—all aspects of the charm of her unusual nature, as initially presented—had become more noticeable as they withstood movement and change. She possessed skills and unique traits that were hard to describe but were a daily delight if you lived with her. She had the art of being almost tragically impatient yet making it seem lighthearted. She had the skill of being inexplicably sad but making it as clear as daylight. She had the ability to be undeniably cheerful but making it as gentle as twilight. By this time, Mrs. Stringham understood everything, and her admiration and amazement were stronger than ever. She thought it was enough to experience her companion's feelings, but there were specific understandings she hadn't yet grasped, impressions that suddenly seemed new to her.</i></p></div>

This particular day on the great Swiss road had
been, for some reason, full of them, and they referred
themselves, provisionally, to some deeper
depth than she had touched—though into two or
three such depths, it must be added, she had peeped
long enough to find herself suddenly draw back. It
was not Milly's unpacified state, in short, that now
troubled her—though certainly, as Europe was the
great American sedative, the failure was to some
extent to be noted: it was the suspected presence
of something behind it—which, however, could
scarcely have taken its place there since their departure.
What any fresh motive of unrest could
suddenly have sprung from was, in short, not to be
divined. It was but half an explanation to say that
excitement, for each of them, had naturally dropped,
and that what they had left behind, or tried to—the
great serious facts of life, as Mrs. Stringham liked
to call them—was once more coming into sight
as objects loom through smoke when smoke begins
to clear; for these were general appearances from
which the girl's own aspect, her really larger vagueness,
seemed rather to disconnect itself. The nearest
approach to a personal anxiety indulged in as
yet by the elder lady was on her taking occasion to
wonder if what she had more than anything else
got hold of mightn't be one of the finer, one of the
finest, one of the rarest—as she called it so that she
might call it nothing worse—cases of American
intensity. She had just had a moment of alarm—asked
herself if her young friend were merely going
to treat her to some complicated drama of nerves. At
the end of a week, however, with their further progress,
her young friend had effectively answered the
question and given her the impression, indistinct indeed
as yet, of something that had a reality compared
with which the nervous explanation would have
been coarse. Mrs. Stringham found herself from
that hour, in other words, in presence of an explanation
that remained a muffled and intangible
form, but that, assuredly, should it take on sharpness,
would explain everything and more than
everything, would become instantly the light in
which Milly was to be read.

It was the suspicion that something was lurking behind it all, something that couldn't possibly have appeared since they left home.

These were general observations, and the girl's own condition, her broader sense of unease, seemed rather separate from them. The closest the older woman had come to a personal worry was when she wondered if what she'd discovered might be one of the more subtle, one of the finest, one of the rarest—she used that language so she wouldn't have to use anything worse—cases of intense American behavior. She'd briefly been concerned, wondering if her young friend was just going to put on some complicated act based on her nerves. After a week, however, as they continued traveling, her young friend had effectively answered that question and given her the still-vague impression of something truly real, something compared to which the nervous explanation seemed crude. From that point on, in other words, Mrs. Stringham found herself facing an explanation that remained vague and undefined, but which, if it ever sharpened, would undoubtedly explain everything and more, and would immediately become the key to understanding Milly.</i></p></div>

Such a matter as this may at all events speak of
the style in which our young woman could affect
those who were near her, may testify to the sort of
interest she could inspire. She worked—and seemingly
quite without design—upon the sympathy,
the curiosity, the fancy of her associates, and we
shall really ourselves scarce otherwise come closer
to her than by feeling their impression and sharing,
if need be, their confusion. She reduced them, Mrs.
Stringham would have said, reduced them to a consenting
bewilderment; which was precisely, for that
good lady, on a last analysis, what was most in
harmony with her greatness. She exceeded, escaped
measure, was surprising only because <i>they</i>
were so far from great. Thus it was that on this
wondrous day on the Brünig the spell of watching
her had grown more than ever irresistible; a proof
of what—or of a part of what—Mrs. Stringham had,
with all the rest, been reduced to. She had almost
the sense of tracking her young friend as if at a
given moment to pounce. She knew she shouldn't
pounce, she hadn't come out to pounce; yet she
felt her attention secretive, all the same, and her
observation scientific. She struck herself as hovering
like a spy, applying tests, laying traps, concealing
signs. This would last, however, only till she
should fairly know what was the matter; and to
watch was, after all, meanwhile, a way of clinging
to the girl, not less than an occupation, a satisfaction
in itself. The pleasure of watching, moreover,
if a reason were needed, came from a sense
of her beauty. Her beauty hadn't at all originally
seemed a part of the situation, and Mrs. Stringham
had, even in the first flush of friendship, not named
it, grossly, to any one; having seen early that, for
stupid people—and who, she sometimes secretly
asked herself, wasn't stupid?—it would take a great
deal of explaining. She had learned not to mention
it till it was mentioned first—which occasionally
happened, but not too often; and then she was
there in force. Then she both warmed to the perception
that met her own perception, and disputed
it, suspiciously, as to special items; while, in general,
she had learned to refine even to the point of
herself employing the word that most people employed.
She employed it to pretend that she was
also stupid and so have done with the matter; spoke
of her friend as plain, as ugly even, in a case of
especially dense insistence; but as, in appearance,
so "awfully full of things." This was her own
way of describing a face that, thanks, doubtless, to
rather too much forehead, too much nose and too
much mouth, together with too little mere conventional
colour and conventional line, was expressive,
irregular, exquisite, both for speech and for silence.
When Milly smiled it was a public event—when she
didn't it was a chapter of history. They had
stopped, on the Brünig, for luncheon, and there
had come up for them under the charm of the place
the question of a longer stay.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>This whole thing gives us a sense of how this young woman affected the people around her, and the kind of interest she could spark. She seemed to effortlessly influence the sympathy, curiosity, and imagination of her friends. Honestly, the best way for us to understand her is to feel their reactions and, if necessary, share in their confusion. Mrs. Stringham would say she reduced them, reduced them to a state of willing bewilderment. And for that good woman, that was the ultimate indication of this woman's greatness. She was exceptional, defied expectations, and was surprising simply because they weren't particularly remarkable themselves. So, on this amazing day on the Brünig, the pull of watching her was stronger than ever. It proved—or at least partially proved—what Mrs. Stringham, along with everyone else, had been reduced to. She almost felt like she was secretly following her young friend, ready to pounce. She knew she shouldn't, she hadn't come out looking to pounce, but her attention felt hidden, almost scientific. She felt like a spy, setting up tests, laying traps, and hiding clues. However, that would only last until she figured out what was really going on. But for now, watching her was a way of staying connected to the girl, and it was also something to do and enjoy. The pleasure of watching her, if a reason were needed, was rooted in her beauty. Her beauty hadn't initially seemed to be a key element, and Mrs. Stringham, even early in their friendship, hadn't explicitly mentioned it to anyone. She knew early on that for some people—and secretly, she sometimes wondered, who *wasn't* stupid?—it would take a lot of explanation. She learned not to bring it up until someone else did—which happened occasionally, but not often. Then she would jump in. She would embrace the other person's observation, but also argue with them about specific aspects of it. Generally, she had learned to be subtle enough to use the same word most people used. She would use it to pretend she was also dense and to get the topic over with. She’d describe her friend as plain, even ugly, when someone was being particularly insistent. But in reality, she said the woman was "awfully full of things." That was her way of describing a face that, perhaps because of a rather prominent forehead, nose, and mouth, along with a lack of conventional color and features, was expressive, unusual, and exquisite, both in moments of speech and silence. When Milly smiled, it was a major event. When she didn't, it was a historical moment.

Mrs. Stringham was now on the ground of
thrilled recognitions, small sharp echoes of a past
which she kept in a well-thumbed case, but which,
on pressure of a spring and exposure to the air,
still showed itself ticking as hard as an honest old
watch. The embalmed "Europe" of her younger
time had partly stood for three years of Switzerland,
a term of continuous school at Vevey, with rewards
of merit in the form of silver medals tied by blue
ribbons and mild mountain-passes attacked with
alpenstocks. It was the good girls who, in the holidays,
were taken highest, and our friend could now
judge, from what she supposed her familiarity with
the minor peaks, that she had been one of the best.
These reminiscences, sacred to-day because prepared
in the hushed chambers of the past, had been
part of the general train laid for the pair of sisters,
daughters early fatherless, by their brave Vermont
mother, who struck her at present as having apparently,
almost like Columbus, worked out, all unassisted,
a conception of the other side of the globe.
She had focussed Vevey, by the light of nature, and
with extraordinary completeness, at Burlington;
after which she had embarked, sailed, landed, explored
and, above all, made good her presence.
She had given her daughters the five years in
Switzerland and Germany that were to leave them
ever afterwards a standard of comparison for all
cycles of Cathay, and to stamp the younger in especial—Susan
was the younger—with a character
that, as Mrs. Stringham had often had occasion,
through life, to say to herself, made all the difference.
It made all the difference for Mrs. Stringham,
over and over again and in the most remote
connections, that, thanks to her parent's lonely,
thrifty, hardy faith, she was a woman of the world.
There were plenty of women who were all sorts of
things that she wasn't, but who, on the other hand,
were not that, and who didn't know <i>she</i> was (which
she liked—it relegated them still further) and didn't
know, either, how it enabled her to judge them.
She had never seen herself so much in this light as
during the actual phase of her associated, if slightly
undirected, pilgrimage; and the consciousness gave
perhaps to her plea for a pause more intensity than
she knew. The irrecoverable days had come back
to her from far off; they were part of the sense of
the cool upper air and of everything else that hung
like an indestructible scent to the torn garment of
youth—the taste of honey and the luxury of milk,
the sound of cattle-bells and the rush of streams, the
fragrance of trodden balms and the dizziness of deep
gorges.

Milly clearly felt these things too, but they affected
her companion at moments—that was quite
the way Mrs. Stringham would have expressed it—as
the princess in a conventional tragedy might
have affected the confidant if a personal emotion
had ever been permitted to the latter. That a princess
could only be a princess was a truth with which,
essentially, a confidant, however responsive, had to
live. Mrs. Stringham was a woman of the world,
but Milly Theale was a princess, the only one she
had yet had to deal with, and this in its way, too,
made all the difference. It was a perfectly definite
doom for the wearer—it was for every one else
a perfectly palpable quality. It might have been,
possibly, with its involved loneliness and other mysteries,
the weight under which she fancied her companion's
admirable head occasionally, and ever so
submissively, bowed. Milly had quite assented at
luncheon to their staying over, and had left her to
look at rooms, settle questions, arrange about their
keeping on their carriage and horses; cares that
had now moreover fallen to Mrs. Stringham as a
matter of course and that yet for some reason, on
this occasion particularly, brought home to her—all
agreeably, richly, almost grandly—what it was to
live with the great. Her young friend had, in a
sublime degree, a sense closed to the general question
of difficulty, which she got rid of, furthermore,
not in the least as one had seen many charming
persons do, by merely passing it on to others. She
kept it completely at a distance: it never entered
the circle; the most plaintive confidant couldn't
have dragged it in; and to tread the path of a confidant
was accordingly to live exempt. Service was
in other words so easy to render that the whole
thing was like court life without the hardships. It
came back of course to the question of money, and
our observant lady had by this time repeatedly reflected
that if one were talking of the "difference,"
it was just this, this incomparably and nothing else,
that when all was said and done most made it. A
less vulgarly, a less obviously purchasing or parading
person she couldn't have imagined; but it was,
all the same, the truth of truths that the girl couldn't
get away from her wealth. She might leave her
conscientious companion as freely alone with it as
possible and never ask a question, scarce even tolerate
a reference; but it was in the fine folds of the
helplessly expensive little black frock that she drew
over the grass as she now strolled vaguely off; it
was in the curious and splendid coils of hair,
"done" with no eye whatever to the <i>mode du jour,</i>
that peeped from under the corresponding indifference
of her hat, the merely personal tradition that
suggested a sort of noble inelegance; it lurked between
the leaves of the uncut but antiquated Tauchnitz
volume of which, before going out, she had
mechanically possessed herself. She couldn't dress
it away, nor walk it away, nor read it away, nor
think it away; she could neither smile it away in
any dreamy absence nor blow it away in any softened
sigh. She couldn't have lost it if she had
tried—that was what it was to be really rich. It
had to be <i>the</i> thing you were. When at the end of
an hour she had not returned to the house Mrs.
Stringham, though the bright afternoon was yet
young, took, with precautions, the same direction,
went to join her in case of her caring for a walk.
But the purpose of joining her was in truth less distinct
than that of a due regard for a possibly preferred
detachment: so that, once more, the good
lady proceeded with a quietness that made her
slightly "underhand" even in her own eyes. She
couldn't help that, however, and she didn't care,
sure as she was that what she really wanted was not
to overstep, but to stop in time. It was to be able
to stop in time that she went softly, but she had
on this occasion further to go than ever yet, for
she followed in vain, and at last with some anxiety,
the footpath she believed Milly to have taken. It
wound up a hillside and into the higher Alpine
meadows in which, all these last days, they had so
often wanted, as they passed above or below, to
stray; and then it obscured itself in a wood, but
always going up, up, and with a small cluster of
brown old high-perched chalets evidently for its
goal. Mrs. Stringham reached in due course the
chalets, and there received from a bewildered old
woman, a very fearful person to behold, an indication
that sufficiently guided her. The young lady
had been seen not long before passing further on,
over a crest and to a place where the way would
drop again, as our unappeased inquirer found it, in
fact, a quarter of an hour later, markedly and almost
alarmingly to do. It led somewhere, yet apparently
quite into space, for the great side of the mountain
appeared, from where she pulled up, to fall away
altogether, though probably but to some issue below
and out of sight. Her uncertainty moreover
was brief, for she next became aware of the presence
on a fragment of rock, twenty yards off, of the
Tauchnitz volume that the girl had brought out,
and that therefore pointed to her shortly previous
passage. She had rid herself of the book, which
was an encumbrance, and meant of course to pick
it up on her return; but as she hadn't yet picked it
up what on earth had become of her? Mrs. Stringham,
I hasten to add, was within a few moments to
see; but it was quite an accident that she had not,
before they were over, betrayed by her deeper agitation
the fact of her own nearness.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly clearly felt things, but they affected her companion at certain moments—that’s how Mrs. Stringham would have phrased it—the same way a princess in a classic tragedy might affect her confidante if the latter were allowed to express personal emotions. The simple fact was that a princess could only be a princess, and a confidante, however sympathetic, had to accept that. Mrs. Stringham was worldly, but Milly Theale was a princess, the only one she’d ever dealt with. That made all the difference too. It was a definite fate for the princess, and for everyone else, a clear characteristic. Mrs. Stringham imagined it was the burden that made her companion’s admirable head bow occasionally, always respectfully. Milly had agreed to stay over for lunch and had left Mrs. Stringham to look at rooms, sort out arrangements, and take care of keeping their carriage and horses. These responsibilities had naturally fallen to Mrs. Stringham, and yet, on this occasion, they brought home to her—pleasantly, richly, almost grandly—what it meant to live with the wealthy. Her young friend had a remarkable ability to avoid difficulty, and she didn’t pass it on to others, as many charming people do. She kept it completely separate, never letting it interfere. The most complaining confidante couldn’t have dragged it into their conversation. Thus, being a confidante meant living an easy life. In other words, serving was so effortless that it felt like court life without the hardship. It came back to the question of money, and Mrs. Stringham had repeatedly realized that if there was a "difference," it was exactly this, and nothing else, that made the biggest impact. She couldn’t imagine a less vulgar or showy person, but the truth was that the girl couldn’t escape her wealth. She might leave her conscientious companion alone with it and never ask a question, hardly even acknowledge it, but it was in the elegant folds of the expensive black dress she wore while strolling across the grass; it was in the curious and beautiful hairstyle, styled without regard to current fashion, peeking from under the similarly casual hat, the personal tradition suggesting a sort of noble lack of elegance; it lingered between the pages of the uncut, antiquated Tauchnitz book she had picked up before going out. She couldn't dress it away, or walk it away, or read it away, or think it away. She couldn’t smile it away in absent-mindedness or blow it away in a soft sigh. She couldn't have lost it if she tried—that's what being truly rich meant. It was just who she was. When Milly hadn't returned after an hour, Mrs. Stringham, although it was still early afternoon, took precautions and followed the same path, intending to join her in case she wanted company on her walk. But the intention to join her was less clear than a desire to respect a possibly preferred solitude, so the good lady proceeded quietly, which made her feel slightly "underhanded," even to herself. She couldn't help it, and she didn’t care, because she was sure that she really wanted not to overstep her boundaries, but to stop in time. She went softly to be able to stop in time, but on this occasion she needed to go further than ever before, as she searched in vain for Milly, following the footpath she believed her to have taken. It wound up a hillside and into the high Alpine meadows where they had often wanted to wander, then disappeared into a wood, always going up, up, and toward a small group of brown, old, high-perched chalets. Mrs. Stringham eventually reached the chalets and was guided by a bewildered old woman, a very frightening sight. The young lady had recently been seen passing further on, over a crest, to a place where the path dropped down again, as Mrs. Stringham realized a quarter of an hour later. The path led somewhere, but seemingly nowhere, because the side of the mountain appeared to fall away altogether, although likely to some point below and out of sight. Her uncertainty was brief, because she then noticed the Tauchnitz book on a rock twenty yards away, which meant Milly had recently passed that way. She had gotten rid of the book, which was a burden, and meant to pick it up on her return. But since she hadn't yet picked it up, what had happened to her? Mrs. Stringham was about to find out, but by chance, she hadn't revealed her inner turmoil before.</i></p></div>

The whole place, with the descent of the path
and as a sequel to a sharp turn that was masked by
rocks and shrubs, appeared to fall precipitously and
to become a "view" pure and simple, a view of
great extent and beauty, but thrown forward and
vertiginous. Milly, with the promise of it from just
above, had gone straight down to it, not stopping
till it was all before her; and here, on what struck
her friend as the dizzy edge of it, she was seated
at her ease. The path somehow took care of itself
and its final business, but the girl's seat was a slab
of rock at the end of a short promontory or excrescence
that merely pointed off to the right into
gulfs of air and that was so placed by good fortune,
if not by the worst, as to be at last completely
visible. For Mrs. Stringham stifled a cry on taking
in what she believed to be the danger of such a
perch for a mere maiden; her liability to slip, to
slide, to leap, to be precipitated by a single false
movement, by a turn of the head—how could one
tell? into whatever was beneath. A thousand
thoughts, for the minute, roared in the poor lady's
ears, but without reaching, as happened, Milly's. It
was a commotion that left our observer intensely
still and holding her breath. What had first been
offered her was the possibility of a latent intention—however
wild the idea—in such a posture; of
some betrayed accordance of Milly's caprice with
a horrible hidden obsession. But since Mrs. Stringham
stood as motionless as if a sound, a syllable,
must have produced the start that would be fatal,
so even the lapse of a few seconds had a partly
reassuring effect. It gave her time to receive the
impression which, when she some minutes later
softly retraced her steps, was to be the sharpest she
carried away. This was the impression that if the
girl was deeply and recklessly meditating there, she
was not meditating a jump; she was on the contrary,
as she sat, much more in a state of uplifted
and unlimited possession that had nothing to gain
from violence. She was looking down on the kingdoms
of the earth, and though indeed that of itself
might well go to the brain, it wouldn't be with a
view of renouncing them. Was she choosing
among them, or did she want them all? This question,
before Mrs. Stringham had decided what to
do, made others vain; in accordance with which she
saw, or believed she did, that if it might be dangerous
to call out, to sound in any way a surprise, it
would probably be safe enough to withdraw as she
had come. She watched a while longer, she held
her breath, and she never knew afterwards what
time had elapsed.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The entire area, with the path sloping downwards and following a sharp bend hidden by rocks and bushes, seemed to plunge downwards dramatically, becoming purely a "view." It was a vast and beautiful panorama, but also overwhelming and dizzying. Milly, having been shown the promise of it from above, had immediately descended to it, not stopping until she was completely immersed in it. Now, perched on what seemed to her friend like the precarious edge of it, she sat comfortably. The path seemed to manage itself and its final descent, but the girl's seat was a rock slab at the end of a short, protruding ledge that jutted out to the right, into open air. Luckily, or perhaps unfortunately, the ledge was completely visible. Mrs. Stringham suppressed a gasp, terrified by what she perceived as the danger of such a position for a young woman. The risk of slipping, sliding, jumping, or being thrown off by a single wrong move, a turn of the head—who could say?—into whatever lay below. A thousand panicked thoughts raced through the poor woman's mind for a moment, but none of them reached Milly. It was a turmoil that left our observer intensely still and holding her breath. The initial thought that came to her was the possibility of a hidden intention—however wild the idea—behind that posture; some secret agreement between Milly's whim and a horrifying, secret obsession. But since Mrs. Stringham stood as still as if any sound would trigger a fatal start, even the passage of a few seconds had a partly reassuring effect. It gave her time to receive an impression which, when she slowly retraced her steps a few minutes later, would be the most vivid she took away with her. This was the impression that if the girl was deeply and recklessly contemplating something there, she wasn’t contemplating a jump; on the contrary, as she sat, she was more in a state of elevated and limitless possession that had nothing to gain from a violent act. She was looking down on all the world, and while that in itself could be overwhelming, she wasn't considering renouncing it. Was she choosing among the kingdoms of the earth, or did she want them all? This question, before Mrs. Stringham had decided what to do, made all others irrelevant. So she realized, or thought she did, that while it might be dangerous to call out, to in any way startle her, it would probably be safe enough to leave as she had come. She watched a little longer, held her breath, and never afterward knew how much time had passed.</i></p></div>

Not many minutes probably, yet they had not
seemed few, and they had given her so much to
think of, not only while creeping home, but while
waiting afterwards at the inn, that she was still busy
with them when, late in the afternoon, Milly reappeared.
She had stopped at the point of the path
where the Tauchnitz lay, had taken it up and, with
the pencil attached to her watch-guard, had scrawled
a word—<i>à bientôt!</i>—across the cover; then, even
under the girl's continued delay, had measured time
without a return of alarm. For she now saw that
the great thing she had brought away was precisely
a conviction that the future was not to exist for
her princess in the form of any sharp or simple release
from the human predicament. It wouldn't
be for her a question of a flying leap and thereby
of a quick escape. It would be a question of taking
full in the face the whole assault of life, to the
general muster of which indeed her face might
have been directly presented as she sat there on
her rock. Mrs. Stringham was thus able to say
to herself, even after another interval of some
length, that if her young friend still continued absent
it wouldn't be because—whatever the opportunity—she
had cut short the thread. She
wouldn't have committed suicide; she knew herself
unmistakably reserved for some more complicated
passage; this was the very vision in which
she had, with no little awe, been discovered. The
image that thus remained with the elder lady kept
the character of revelation. During the breathless
minutes of her watch she had seen her companion
afresh; the latter's type, aspect, marks, her history,
her state, her beauty, her mystery, all unconsciously
betrayed themselves to the Alpine air, and all had
been gathered in again to feed Mrs. Stringham's
flame. They are things that will more distinctly
appear for us, and they are meanwhile briefly represented
by the enthusiasm that was stronger on
our friend's part than any doubt. It was a consciousness
she was scarce yet used to carrying, but
she had as beneath her feet a mine of something
precious. She seemed to herself to stand near the
mouth, not yet quite cleared. The mine but needed
working and would certainly yield a treasure. She
was not thinking, either, of Milly's gold.

Those minutes had given her so much to ponder, not only on her walk home but also while waiting at the inn afterward. She was still preoccupied with them when Milly returned late in the afternoon. Milly had stopped at the path where she’d left the book, picked it up, and written "See you soon!" on the cover with the pencil attached to her watch. Even though the girl was taking a while, Mrs. Stringham wasn't worried. She realized the most important thing she'd taken away was the firm belief that the future wouldn't offer her princess a quick or easy escape from life's challenges. It wouldn't be a matter of a sudden leap and freedom. It would be about bravely facing everything life threw at her, and in fact, her face, as she sat there on the rock, might have been the perfect representation of that general struggle. Mrs. Stringham could tell herself, even after another delay, that if her young friend continued to be absent, it wouldn't be because—whatever the chance—she had ended things. She wouldn't have killed herself. She knew she was destined for something more complex. This was the very image she had, with a touch of awe, come to realize. The image that stayed with the older woman had the quality of a revelation. During those tense minutes of waiting, she had seen her friend anew. Her type, appearance, characteristics, her past, her situation, her beauty, and her mystery all revealed themselves unconsciously in the mountain air and had all been absorbed again to fuel Mrs. Stringham's excitement. These things will become clearer to us, and they are briefly represented by the stronger enthusiasm of our friend than any doubt. It was a feeling she wasn't used to carrying yet, but she felt like she had something incredibly valuable at her feet. She felt like she was standing near the entrance of a mine, which wasn’t quite cleared yet. The mine only needed to be worked and would certainly produce a treasure. She wasn't thinking about Milly's actual wealth, either.</i></p></div>
