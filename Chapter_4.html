<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>A man receives a telegram from Mrs. Lowder and goes to her house at Lancaster Gate, where he waits in her drawing-room for a long time. When Mrs. Lowder appears, she tells him that she intends for her niece, Kate, to marry a "great man." She says that while he is incompatible with this plan, she will not banish him but will allow him to continue to see Kate.</p><p>The man, Densher, later tells Kate about the meeting. He also informs her that his newspaper has offered him a multi-week assignment in America, which he must start immediately. Kate urges him to go. He then tells her about his foreign upbringing, which Mrs. Lowder had criticized.</p><p>While in a park, Kate spontaneously tells Densher, "I engage myself to you for ever," and he pledges himself to her in return. They move to a more private spot where they exchange vows and seal their compact, becoming an affianced couple. They agree to keep their engagement a secret for the time being. They discuss how they will correspond while he is away and what Kate will say if her aunt questions their relationship. Kate says she will admit that she loves him. Densher embraces her before he departs.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Merton Densher**</li>
He is presented as a highly analytical and self-aware man, conscious of his social and financial inferiority. He enters the situation prepared to be "patient, ridiculous, [and] diplomatic" for the woman he loves. Initially, he is intimidated by Mrs. Lowder's wealth and power, which he views with aesthetic revulsion, feeling it as a "portentous negation of his own world." His situation shifts dramatically when the dreaded confrontation with Mrs. Lowder turns into a surprisingly civil, strategic negotiation. This is immediately followed by an unexpected professional opportunity—a journalistic assignment in America—and a secret engagement to Kate. He moves from a position of anxious waiting to one of active commitment and impending departure.
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
She is presented as a formidable, powerful, and strategic figure, whose character is first established by her "massive, florid" and "colossally vulgar" home. Densher perceives her as a "lioness" and a force comparable to the "car of Juggernaut." In person, however, she is surprisingly "bland" and "adroit," choosing not to use open aggression. She sees her niece as a valuable "investment" and operates with a clear, long-term plan. Her situation remains unchanged; she is the established power, confidently manipulating events by granting limited approval to Densher, whom she shrewdly assesses and seems to personally, if conditionally, like.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li></ul>
Presented through Densher's eyes as a figure of "pride," she reveals herself in dialogue to be intelligent, pragmatic, and decisive. She fully understands her aunt's strategy and immediately grasps the importance of Densher's job offer, urging him to accept. Her situation shifts from being the subject of a power struggle to an active agent in her own future. She initiates a secret but profound engagement with Densher ("I engage myself to you for ever"), solidifying their bond and establishing a clear, clandestine plan before his departure.

<p>
His eyes had followed her at this time quite long
enough, before he overtook her, to make out more
than ever, in the poise of her head, the pride of her
step—he didn't know what best to call it—a part,
at least, of Mrs. Lowder's reasons. He consciously
winced while he figured his presenting himself as
a reason opposed to these; though, at the same
moment, with the source of Aunt Maud's inspiration
thus before him, he was prepared to conform,
by almost any abject attitude or profitable compromise,
to his companion's easy injunction. He
would do as <i>she</i> liked—his own liking might come
off as it would. He would help her to the utmost
of his power; for, all the rest of that day and the
next, her easy injunction, tossed off that way as
she turned her beautiful back, was like the crack
of a great whip in the blue air, the high element in
which Mrs. Lowder hung. He wouldn't grovel
perhaps—he wasn't quite ready for that; but he
would be patient, ridiculous, reasonable, unreasonable,
and above all deeply diplomatic. He would
be clever, with all his cleverness—which he now
shook hard, as he sometimes shook his poor, dear,
shabby, old watch, to start it up again. It wasn't,
thank goodness, as if there weren't plenty of that,
and with what they could muster between them it
would be little to the credit of their star, however
pale, that defeat and surrender—surrender so early,
so immediate—should have to ensue. It was not
indeed that he thought of that disaster as, at the
worst, a direct sacrifice of their possibilities: he imaged—it
which was enough as some proved vanity,
some exposed fatuity, in the idea of bringing
Mrs. Lowder round. When, shortly afterwards, in
this lady's vast drawing-room—the apartments at
Lancaster Gate had struck him from the first as of
prodigious extent—he awaited her, at her request,
conveyed in a "reply-paid" telegram, his theory
was that of their still clinging to their idea, though
with a sense of the difficulty of it really enlarged to
the scale of the place.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He had been watching her for a while before he caught up to her. He noticed, in the way she held her head and the confidence in her stride – he didn't know what to call it exactly – something that explained, at least in part, Mrs. Lowder's motives. He felt a pang of discomfort as he imagined presenting himself as someone who would go against those motives. But at the same time, with the source of Aunt Maud's influence right there, he was ready to do whatever it took, no matter how humiliating or compromising, to please his companion. He would do whatever she wanted; his own desires didn’t matter. He would help her as much as he could because, for the rest of that day and the next, her casual instruction, delivered as she turned away with her beautiful back, felt like a whip cracking in the air, the rarefied atmosphere in which Mrs. Lowder reigned. He wouldn’t grovel, perhaps – he wasn’t quite prepared for that – but he would be patient, even ridiculous, reasonable, unreasonable, and, above all, very diplomatic. He would use all his cleverness – which he was now frantically trying to summon, just as he sometimes shook his old, worn-out watch to get it working again. Thank goodness, it wasn't as if they were short on cleverness. And given their combined skills, it would be a poor reflection on their abilities, however limited, if they had to surrender so early. It wasn't really that he saw defeat as a complete loss of their chances; instead, he thought of it – which was bad enough – as some kind of vanity, some foolishness, in the idea of convincing Mrs. Lowder. When, soon after, he was waiting for her in her huge drawing-room – the apartments at Lancaster Gate had struck him as enormous from the very beginning – at her request, conveyed in a "reply-paid" telegram, his theory was that they would still cling to their idea, although with a heightened sense of the difficulty of it, really enlarged to the scale of the place.</i></p></div>

<p>
He had the place for a long time—it seemed to
him a quarter of an hour—to himself; and while
Aunt Maud kept him and kept him, while observation
and reflection crowded on him, he asked himself
what was to be expected of a person who could
treat one like that. The visit, the hour were of
her own proposing, so that her delay, no doubt,
was but part of a general plan of putting him to
inconvenience. As he walked to and fro, however,
taking in the message of her massive, florid furniture,
the immense expression of her signs and symbols,
he had as little doubt of the inconvenience he
was prepared to suffer. He found himself even facing
the thought that he had nothing to fall back
on, and that that was as great a humiliation in a
good cause as a proud man could desire. It had
not yet been so distinct to him that he made no
show—literally not the smallest; so complete a
show seemed made there all about him; so almost
abnormally affirmative, so aggressively erect, were
the huge, heavy objects that syllabled his hostess
story. "When all's said and done, you know, she's
colossally vulgar"—he had once all but said that
of Mrs. Lowder to her niece; only just keeping it
back at the last, keeping it to himself with all its
danger about it. It mattered because it bore so
directly, and he at all events quite felt it a thing that
Kate herself would some day bring out to him. It
bore directly at present, and really all the more that
somehow, strangely, it didn't in the least imply that
Aunt Maud was dull or stale. She was vulgar with
freshness, almost with beauty, since there was
beauty, to a degree, in the play of so big and bold
a temperament. She was in fine quite the largest
possible quantity to deal with; and he was in the
cage of the lioness without his whip—the whip, in a
word, of a supply of proper retorts. He had no
retort but that he loved the girl—which in such a
house as that was painfully cheap. Kate had mentioned
to him more than once that her aunt was
Passionate, speaking of it as a kind of offset and
uttering it as with a capital P, marking it as something
that he might, that he in fact ought to, turn
about in some way to their advantage. He wondered
at this hour to what advantage he could turn
it; but the case grew less simple the longer he
waited. Decidedly there was something he hadn't
enough of. He stood as one fast.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He had the place to himself for a long time—it felt like only fifteen minutes—and while he was alone, waiting for Aunt Maud, and while he was observing everything around him and thinking, he wondered what to expect from someone who could treat him this way. The visit, the appointment, was her idea, so her lateness was probably just part of a plan to inconvenience him. But as he paced back and forth, taking in the message of her massive, ornate furniture, the overwhelming statement of her décor, he didn't doubt that he was prepared to be inconvenienced. He even realized that he had nothing to fall back on, and that it was as great a humiliation in a good cause as a proud man could want. He hadn't fully acknowledged that he was putting on no act—literally not even a small one. The place was so full of her presence. The huge, heavy objects were so assertive, so overwhelmingly imposing, and told the story of his hostess. "When it comes down to it, you know, she's incredibly vulgar"—he'd almost said that about Mrs. Lowder to her niece, but he'd stopped himself at the last moment, keeping the thought to himself because it was so risky. It mattered because it was so relevant, and he felt it was something that Kate herself would eventually say to him. It was relevant now, and even more so because, strangely, it didn't mean that Aunt Maud was boring or stale. She was vulgar in a fresh way, almost beautiful, because there was a degree of beauty in the display of such a big and bold personality. She was, in short, the largest possible challenge to deal with; and he was in the lioness's cage without a whip—the whip, in other words, of clever comebacks. His only comeback was that he loved the girl—which was painfully inadequate in a house like this. Kate had mentioned to him more than once that her aunt was passionate, treating it as a contrast and emphasizing it with a capital P, implying it was something that he might, that he actually should, use to their advantage somehow. He wondered at this moment how he could use it to his advantage, but the situation became less clear the longer he waited. There was definitely something he lacked. He felt trapped.</i></p></div>

<p>
His slow march to and fro seemed to give him
the very measure; as he paced and paced the distance
it became the desert of his poverty; at the
sight of which expanse moreover he could pretend
to himself as little as before that the desert looked
redeemable. Lancaster Gate looked rich—that was
all the effect; which it was unthinkable that any
state of his own should ever remotely resemble. He
read more vividly, more critically, as has been
hinted, the appearances about him; and they did
nothing so much as make him wonder at his aesthetic
reaction. He hadn't known—and in spite
of Kate's repeated reference to her own rebellions
of taste—that he should "mind" so much how an
independent lady might decorate her house. It was
the language of the house itself that spoke to him,
writing out for him, with surpassing breadth and
freedom, the associations and conceptions, the
ideals and possibilities of the mistress. Never, he
flattered himself, had he seen anything so gregariously
ugly—operatively, ominously so cruel. He
was glad to have found this last name for the whole
character; "cruel" somehow played into the subject
for an article—that his impression put straight
into his mind. He would write about the heavy
horrors that could still flourish, that lifted their
undiminished heads, in an age so proud of its short
way with false gods; and it would be funny if what
he should have got from Mrs. Lowder were to
prove, after all, but a small amount of copy. Yet
the great thing, really the dark thing, was that, even
while he thought of the quick column he might
add up, he felt it less easy to laugh at the heavy
horrors than to quail before them. He couldn't
describe and dismiss them collectively, call them
either Mid-Victorian or Early; not being at all sure
they were rangeable under one rubric. It was only
manifest they were splendid and were furthermore
conclusively British. They constituted an order and
they abounded in rare material—precious woods,
metals, stuffs, stones. He had never dreamed of
anything so fringed and scalloped, so buttoned and
corded, drawn everywhere so tight, and curled
everywhere so thick. He had never dreamed of so
much gilt and glass, so much satin and plush, so
much rosewood and marble and malachite. But it
was, above all, the solid forms, the wasted finish,
the misguided cost, the general attestation of morality
and money, a good conscience and a big balance.
These things finally represented for him a
portentous negation of his own world of thought—of
which, for that matter, in the presence of them,
he became as for the first time hopelessly aware.
They revealed it to him by their merciless difference.
His interview with Aunt Maud, none the less,
took by no means the turn he had expected. Passionate
though her nature, no doubt Mrs. Lowder,
on this occasion, neither threatened nor appealed.
Her arms of aggression, her weapons of defence,
were presumably close at hand, but she left them
untouched and unmentioned, and was in fact so
bland that he properly perceived only afterwards
how adroit she had been. He properly perceived
something else as well, which complicated his case;
he shouldn't have known what to call it if he hadn't
called it her really imprudent good-nature. Her
blandness, in other words, was not mere policy—he
wasn't dangerous enough for policy; it was the result,
he could see, of her fairly liking him a little.
From the moment she did that she herself became
more interesting; and who knew what might happen
should he take to liking <i>her?</i> Well, it was a
risk he naturally must face. She fought him, at
any rate, but with one hand, with a few loose grains
of stray powder. He recognised at the end of ten
minutes, and even without her explaining it, that
if she had made him wait it had not been to wound
him; they had by that time almost directly met
on the fact of her intention. She had wanted him
to think for himself of what she proposed to say
to him—not having otherwise announced it;
wanted to let it come home to him on the spot, as
she had shrewdly believed it would. Her first question,
on appearing, had practically been as to
whether he hadn't taken her hint, and this inquiry
assumed so many things that it made discussion, immediately,
frank and large. He knew, with the
question put, that the hint was just what he <i>had</i>
taken; knew that she had made him quickly forgive
her the display of her power; knew that if he didn't
take care he should understand her, and the
strength of her purpose, to say nothing of that of
her imagination, nothing of the length of her purse,
only too well. Yet he pulled himself up with the
thought, too, that he was not going to be afraid of
understanding her; he was just going to understand
and understand without detriment to the feeblest,
even, of his passions. The play of one's mind let
one in, at the best, dreadfully, in action, in the need
of action, where simplicity was all; but when one
couldn't prevent it the thing was to make it complete.
There would never be mistakes but for the
original fun of mistakes. What he must use his
fatal intelligence for was to resist. Mrs. Lowder,
meanwhile, might use it for whatever she liked.

Seeing this emptiness, he couldn't pretend, any more than before, that the desert could be made habitable. Lancaster Gate looked wealthy—that was the only effect it had. It was impossible for his own situation to ever remotely resemble it. He observed and analyzed the things around him more critically, as has been hinted, and this only made him question his aesthetic reactions.

It would be funny if what he got from Mrs. Lowder was ultimately just a small amount of material for the article. Yet the big, dark truth was that even as he thought about quickly writing his column, he found it less easy to laugh at the heavy horrors than to be intimidated by them. He couldn't describe them all and dismiss them, calling them either Mid-Victorian or Early Victorian, not being sure they could be categorized under a single label. It was obvious, however, that they were grand and definitively British. They represented a certain standard and were full of luxurious materials—precious woods, metals, fabrics, and stones. He had never seen anything so fringed and scalloped, so buttoned and corded, so tightly drawn and thickly curled everywhere. He had never seen so much gold and glass, so much satin and plush, so much rosewood and marble and malachite. But above all, it was the solid forms, the excessive ornamentation, the misplaced cost, and the overall declaration of morality and wealth, a clear conscience, and a large bank account.

She was, in fact, so pleasant that he only realized afterward how cleverly she had acted. He also realized something else, which complicated things; he wouldn't have known what to call it if he hadn't called it her genuinely imprudent kindness. In other words, her pleasantness wasn't just a tactic—he wasn't dangerous enough for her to need to use tactics. He could see that it was the result of her actually liking him a little. From that moment, she herself became more interesting. And who knew what might happen if he started to like her? It was a risk he had to face, of course. She was fighting him, but only with one hand, using a few loose grains of stray powder. He realized after ten minutes, even without her explaining it, that if she had kept him waiting, it wasn't to hurt him. They had essentially agreed on her intentions. She wanted him to figure out for himself what she was going to say to him—not having announced it directly. She wanted him to understand it on the spot, as she cleverly believed he would.

He knew that the question implied that he had understood the hint, that she had made him forgive her the display of her power, and that if he wasn't careful, he would understand her, the strength of her purpose, not to mention her imagination and the size of her fortune, far too well. Yet he also reminded himself that he wasn't going to be afraid of understanding her. He was simply going to understand, without hindering even the weakest of his passions. Using one's mind can make a person disastrously complicated when it comes to action, and the need for simplicity. But when you can't prevent it, the thing to do is embrace it fully. Mistakes are the source of all the original fun. What he must use his dangerous intelligence for was to resist. Meanwhile, Mrs. Lowder could use her intelligence however she wanted.</i></p></div>

It was after she had begun her statement of her
own idea about Kate that he began, on his side, to
reflect that—with her manner of offering it as really
sufficient if he would take the trouble to embrace—it
she couldn't half hate him. That was all, positively,
she seemed to show herself for the time as
attempting; clearly, if she did her intention justice,
she would have nothing more disagreeable to
do. "If I hadn't been ready to go very much
further, you understand, I wouldn't have gone so
far. I don't care what you repeat to her—the more
you repeat to her, perhaps the better; and, at any
rate, there's nothing she doesn't already know. I
don't say it for her; I say it for you—when I want
to reach my niece I know how to do it straight."
So Aunt Maud delivered herself—as with homely
benevolence, in the simplest, but the clearest terms;
virtually conveying that, though a word to the wise
was, doubtless, in spite of the advantage, <i>not</i> always
enough, a word to the good could never fail to be.
The sense our young man read into her words was
that she liked him because he was good—was really,
by her measure, good enough: good enough, that
is, to give up her niece for her and go his way in
peace. But <i>was</i> he good enough—by his own
measure? He fairly wondered, while she more fully
expressed herself, if it might be his doom to prove
so. "She's the finest possible creature—of course
you flatter yourself that you know it. But I know
it, quite as well as you possibly can—by which I
mean a good deal better yet; and the tune to which
I'm ready to prove my faith compares favourably
enough, I think, with anything <i>you</i> can do. I don't
say it because she's my niece—that's nothing to me:
I might have had fifty nieces, and I wouldn't have
brought one of them to this place if I hadn't found
her to my taste. I don't say I wouldn't have done
something else, but I wouldn't have put up with
her presence. Kate's presence, by good fortune,
I marked early; Kate's presence—unluckily for <i>you</i>—is
everything I could possibly wish; Kate's presence
is, in short, as fine as you know, and I've been
keeping it for the comfort of my declining years.
I've watched it long; I've been saving it up and
letting it, as you say of investments, appreciate, and
you may judge whether, now it has begun to pay
so, I'm likely to consent to treat for it with any
but a high bidder. I can do the best with her, and
I've my idea of the best."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>After she'd started explaining her thoughts about Kate, he began to realize, on his end, that she seemed to think he should simply accept her ideas. She seemed to really hate him for it. That was all she appeared to be trying to do at the moment; clearly, if she truly got her way, she wouldn't have anything more unpleasant to deal with. "If I wasn't prepared to go pretty far, understand, I wouldn't have gone this far. I don't care what you tell her—the more you tell her, the better, perhaps; and at any rate, she already knows everything. I'm not saying this for her; I'm saying it for you—I know how to reach my niece directly when I want to."</i></p><p><i>That's how Aunt Maud spoke—with simple, clear kindness, as if to say that while a wise person might not always understand, a good person would never fail.</i></p><p><i>Our young man interpreted her words as meaning she liked him because he was a good person—good enough, in her opinion: good enough, that is, to give up her niece for her and let him go his own way. But was he good enough, according to his own standards? He wondered if he was destined to prove it, as she continued to speak. "She's the most wonderful person—of course you think you realize that. But I know it just as well as you do, maybe even better; and I'm as committed to proving my love as you are. I'm not saying this because she's my niece—that doesn't matter to me: I could have had fifty nieces, and I wouldn't have brought any of them here if I hadn't liked them. I won't say I wouldn't have done something else, but I wouldn't have put up with her being around. Luckily for me, I noticed Kate's presence early on; unfortunately for you, Kate's presence is everything I could want; Kate's presence is, in short, as amazing as you know, and I've been keeping it for myself. I've watched her for a long time; I've been saving her up, letting her, as you would say of investments, appreciate in value, and you can imagine whether I'm likely to let her go for anything less than a very high price now that she's finally started paying off.

It was an oddity of Mrs. Lowder's that her face
in speech was like a lighted window at night, but
that silence immediately drew the curtain. The
occasion for reply allowed by her silence was never
easy to take; yet she was still less easy to interrupt.
The great glaze of her surface, at all events,

She gave him so, on this, the mere effect of the
drawn blind that it quite forced him, at first, into the
sense, possibly just, of having affected her as flippant,
perhaps even as low. He had been looked
at so, in blighted moments of presumptuous youth,
by big cold public men, but never, so far as he
could recall, by any private lady. More than anything
yet it gave him the measure of his companion's
subtlety, and thereby of Kate's possible career.
"Don't be <i>too</i> impossible!"—he feared from his
friend, for a moment, some such answer as that;
and then felt, as she spoke otherwise, as if she were
letting him off easily. "I want her to marry a great
man." That was all; but, more and more, it was
enough; and if it hadn't been her next words would
have made it so. "And I think of her what I think.
There you are."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Her reaction to this – just the way she looked at him, as if he were an annoying detail, like a drawn window shade – immediately made him worry that he’d seemed shallow or even crude. He'd been judged like that before, in humiliating moments of his youth, by important, distant men, but never, as far as he could remember, by a woman. More than anything, this gave him a clear understanding of her intelligence, and thus, of what Kate’s future might be.</i></p><p><i>“Don’t be ridiculous!” He almost expected her to say something like that. But when she spoke, it was as if she were letting him off easy. “I want her to marry a powerful man.” That was it, but it was enough. And if it hadn’t been, her next words would have sealed it. “And I think of her what I think. That’s all.”</i></p></div>

They sat for a little face to face upon it, and he
was conscious of something deeper still, of something
she wished him to understand if he only
would. To that extent she did appeal—appealed
to the intelligence she desired to show she believed
him to possess. He was meanwhile, at all events,
not the man wholly to fail of comprehension. "Of
course I'm aware how little I can answer to any
fond, proud dream. You've a view—a magnificent
one; into which I perfectly enter. I thoroughly understand
what I'm not, and I'm much obliged to
you for not reminding me of it in any rougher
way." She said nothing—she kept that up; it
might even have been to let him go further, if he
was capable of it, in the way of poorness of spirit.
It was one of those cases in which a man couldn't
show, if he showed at all, save for poor; unless
indeed he preferred to show for asinine. It was
the plain truth: he <i>was</i>—on Mrs. Lowder's basis,
the only one in question—a very small quantity,
and he did know, damnably, what made quantities
large. He desired to be perfectly simple; yet in
the midst of that effort a deeper apprehension
throbbed. Aunt Maud clearly conveyed it, though
he couldn't later on have said how. "You don't
really matter, I believe, so much as you think, and
I'm not going to make you a martyr by banishing
you. Your performances with Kate in the Park are
ridiculous so far as they're meant as consideration
for me; and I had much rather see you myself—since
you're, in your way, my dear young man, delightful—and
arrange with you, count with you,
as I easily, as I perfectly should. Do you suppose
me so stupid as to quarrel with you if it's not really
necessary? It won't—it would be too absurd!—<i>be</i>
necessary. I can bite your head off any day, any day
I really open my mouth; and I'm dealing with
you now, see—and successfully judge—without
opening it. I do things handsomely all round—I
place you in the presence of the plan with which,
from the moment it's a case of taking you seriously,
you're incompatible. Come then as near it as you
like, walk all round it—don't be afraid you'll hurt
it!—and live on with it before you."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>They sat facing each other for a bit, and he sensed something more profound, something she wanted him to grasp if he would only try. In a way, she was appealing to him – appealing to the intelligence she wanted to believe he possessed. He, for his part, wasn't entirely oblivious. "Of course, I realize how little I can live up to any grand, idealistic expectations. You have a vision – a magnificent one; and I totally get it. I fully understand what I'm not, and I appreciate you not pointing it out in a harsher way." She didn't say anything, which she continued to do; maybe it was to let him say more, if he was capable of being even more humble. It was one of those situations where a person could only come across as insignificant, unless, of course, they wanted to appear foolish. The simple truth was that he – according to Mrs. Lowder’s standards, the only ones that mattered – was a nobody, and he knew, damn it, what made people important. He wanted to be completely straightforward, but even in trying to do so, a deeper concern resonated. Aunt Maud made it clear, although he couldn't later pinpoint how. "I don't believe you're as significant as you think, and I'm not going to punish you by sending you away. Your little escapades with Kate in the park are ridiculous if you think they're some kind of consideration for me; and I'd much rather see you myself – since, in your own way, you're, my dear young man, quite charming – and deal with you, involve you, as I easily and perfectly can. Do you think I'm so foolish as to argue with you if it's not absolutely necessary? It won't be – it would be too silly! – necessary. I can dismiss you anytime, the moment I actually speak my mind; and I'm dealing with you now, see? And I’m succeeding – without saying a word. I do things elegantly – I’m putting you right in front of the plan, with which, from the moment I start taking you seriously, you can’t possibly fit in.

He afterwards felt that if she hadn't absolutely
phrased all this it was because she so soon made
him out as going with her far enough. He was so
pleasantly affected by her asking no promise of him,
her not proposing he should pay for her indulgence
by his word of honour not to interfere, that he gave
her a kind of general assurance of esteem. Immediately
afterwards, then, he spoke of these things
to Kate, and what then came back to him first of
all was the way he had said to her—he mentioned
it to the girl—very much as one of a pair of lovers
says in a rupture by mutual consent: "I hope immensely,
of course, that you'll always regard me as
a friend." This had perhaps been going far—he
submitted it all to Kate; but really there had been
so much in it that it was to be looked at, as they
might say, wholly in its own light. Other things
than those we have presented had come up before
the close of his scene with Aunt Maud, but this matter
of her not treating him as a peril of the first
order easily predominated. There was moreover
plenty to talk about on the occasion of his subsequent
passage with our young woman, it having
been put to him abruptly, the night before, that he
might give himself a lift and do his newspaper a
service—so flatteringly was the case expressed—by
going, for fifteen or twenty weeks, to America.
The idea of a series of letters from the United States
from the strictly social point of view had for some
time been nursed in the inner sanctuary at whose
door he sat, and the moment was now deemed
happy for letting it loose. The imprisoned thought
had, in a word, on the opening of the door, flown
straight out into Densher's face, or perched at least
on his shoulder, making him look up in surprise
from his mere inky office-table. His account of
the matter to Kate was that he couldn't refuse—not
being in a position, as yet, to refuse anything; but
that his being chosen for such an errand confounded
his sense of proportion. He was definite as to his
scarce knowing how to measure the honour, which
struck him as equivocal; he had not quite supposed
himself the man for the class of job. This confused
consciousness, he intimated, he had promptly
enough betrayed to his manager; with the effect,
however, of seeing the question surprisingly clear
up. What it came to was that the sort of twaddle
that was not in his chords was, unexpectedly, just
what they happened this time not to want. They
wanted his letters, for queer reasons, about as good
as he could let them come; he was to play his own
little tune and not be afraid; that was the whole
point.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Later, he realized that if she hadn't explicitly said everything, it was because she quickly understood he was willing to go along with her. He was so pleased that she didn't ask him for a commitment, that she didn't expect him to promise not to interfere with her, that he gave her a general expression of his respect. Immediately afterward, he discussed these things with Kate. What he remembered first was the way he’d spoken to the woman—he told Kate about it—much like one lover says to another at the end of a relationship, by mutual agreement: “I certainly hope you’ll always think of me as a friend.” Maybe that was too much, he told Kate, but really, it had to be seen on its own terms. Other things had been said before he left Aunt Maud, but the fact that she didn’t treat him as a serious threat was what stuck out most. Moreover, there was plenty to talk about when he later spoke with Kate, because he’d been asked suddenly the night before if he’d consider boosting his career and helping the newspaper—that's how flattering the offer was phrased—by going to America for fifteen or twenty weeks. The idea of a series of social letters from the United States had been brewing in secret for a while, and the time was now right to release it. The hidden thought, once the door opened, had, in other words, flown straight into Densher's face, or at least landed on his shoulder, making him look up in surprise from his desk. He told Kate that he couldn't refuse—he wasn't in a position to refuse anything at the moment—but being chosen for the job felt disproportionate. He was clear that he wasn’t sure how to measure the honor, which seemed uncertain. He hadn't quite thought of himself as the right person for the job. He said he'd been confused, which he'd made clear to his boss. But this had the surprising effect of making everything clearer. It turned out that the kind of superficial writing that he wasn't good at was, unexpectedly, exactly what they didn't want this time. They wanted his letters, for strange reasons, to be as good as he could make them; he should do his own thing and not worry; that was the whole point.</i></p></div>

It would have been the whole, that is, had there
not been a sharper one still in the circumstance that
he was to start at once. His mission, as they called
it at the office, would probably be over by the end
of June, which was desirable; but to bring that
about he must now not lose a week; his inquiries,
he understood, were to cover the whole ground,
and there were reasons of State—reasons operating
at the seat of empire in Fleet Street—why the nail
should be struck on the head. Densher made no
secret to Kate of his having asked for a day to decide;
and his account of that matter was that he
felt he owed it to her to speak to her first. She
assured him on this that nothing so much as that
scruple had yet shown her how they were bound
together; she was clearly proud of his letting a
thing of such importance depend on her; but she
was clearer still as to his instant duty. She rejoiced
in his prospect and urged him to his task; she
should miss him intensely—of course she should
miss him; but she made so little of it that she spoke
with jubilation of what he would see and would
do. She made so much of this last quantity that he
laughed at her innocence, though also with scarce
the heart to give her the real size of his drop in
the daily bucket. He was struck at the same time
with her happy grasp of what had really occurred
in Fleet Street—all the more that it was his own
final reading. He was to pull the subject up—that
was just what they wanted; and it would take
more than all the United States together, visit them
each as he might, to let <i>him</i> down. It was just
because he didn't nose about and wasn't the usual
gossipmonger that they had picked him out; it
was a branch of their correspondence with which
they evidently wished a new tone associated, such
a tone as, from now on, it would have always to
take from his example.

His assignment, as they called it at the office, would likely be finished by the end of June, which was good; but to make that happen, he couldn't waste a week. He understood that his investigation needed to be comprehensive, and there were serious matters – matters concerning the highest levels of power in Fleet Street – that required a definitive answer. Densher told Kate without hesitation that he'd requested a day to think it over, and his reason was that he felt he had to discuss it with her first. She assured him that this hesitation showed her how strong their relationship was; she was clearly pleased that he'd let something so important depend on her, but she was even clearer about his immediate responsibility. She was happy for him and encouraged him to take on the task; she would miss him terribly – of course she would; but she downplayed it so much that she spoke enthusiastically about what he would see and do. She focused so much on the good aspects of it that he laughed at her naivete, though he was reluctant to tell her the full extent of his own disappointment at leaving. He was also impressed by her understanding of what had really happened in Fleet Street – especially since it matched his own understanding. He was supposed to dig up the story – that was precisely what they wanted; and it would take more than all the United States combined, even if he visited every one of them, to let him off the hook. They'd chosen him precisely because he wasn't nosy and wasn't a typical gossip; this was a part of their communication that they clearly wanted to be handled with a fresh approach, an approach that, from now on, would always be modeled on his example.</i></p></div>

She spoke of the future this time as so little
contingent, that he felt a queerness of conscience
in making her the report that he presently arrived
at on what had passed for him with the real
arbiter of their destiny. The way for that had been
blocked a little by his news from Fleet Street; but
in the crucible of their happy discussion this element
soon melted into the other, and in the mixture that
ensued the parts were not to be distinguished. The
young man moreover, before taking his leave, was
to see why Kate had just spoken of the future as
if they now really possessed it, and was to come to
the vision by a devious way that deepened the final
cheer. Their faces were turned to the illumined
quarter as soon as he had answered her question in
respect to the appearance of their being able to
play a waiting game with success. It was for the
possibility of that appearance that she had, a few
days before, so earnestly pressed him to see her
aunt; and if after his hour with that lady it had
not struck Densher that he had seen her to the
happiest purpose the poor facts flushed with a better
meaning as Kate, one by one, took them up.

His news from Fleet Street had initially created a small obstacle. But during their joyful conversation, that obstacle quickly dissolved into everything else, and the different parts of the situation were indistinguishable in the end. Before leaving, the young man also wanted to understand why Kate had just talked about the future as if they already controlled it. He was going to reach this understanding through a roundabout way that ultimately increased their happiness. They both looked towards the bright future as soon as he had answered her question about whether they could successfully wait things out. She had strongly urged him to visit her aunt a few days earlier because of the possibility of creating that impression. And if Densher hadn't realized after meeting her aunt that he'd had the best possible outcome, the discouraging facts suddenly took on a more positive meaning as Kate addressed them one by one.</i></p></div>

"It <i>is</i> everything; everything <i>she</i> thinks it. It's
the probability—I mean as Mrs. Lowder measures
probability—that I may be prevented from becoming
a complication for her by some arrangement,
<i>any</i> arrangement, through which you shall see me
often and easily. She's sure of my want of money,
and that gives her time. She believes in my having
a certain amount of delicacy, in my wishing to better
my state before I put the pistol to your head
in respect to sharing it. The time that will take
figures for her as the time that will help her if she
doesn't spoil her chance by treating me badly. She
doesn't at all wish moreover," Densher went on,
"to treat me badly, for I believe, upon my honour,
funny as it may sound to you, that she personally
rather likes me, and that if you weren't in question
I might almost become her pet young man. She
doesn't disparage intellect and culture—quite the
contrary; she wants them to adorn her board and
be named in her programme; and I'm sure it has
sometimes cost her a real pang that I should be so
desirable, at once, and so impossible." He paused
a moment, and his companion then saw that a
strange smile was in his face—a smile as strange
even as the adjunct, in her own, of this informing
vision. "I quite suspect her of believing that, if
the truth were known, she likes me literally better
than—deep down—you yourself do: wherefore she
does me the honour to think that I may be safely
left to kill my own cause. There, as I say, comes in
her margin. I'm not the sort of stuff of romance
that wears, that washes, that survives use, that resists
familiarity. Once in any degree admit that,
and your pride and prejudice will take care of the
rest! the pride fed full, meanwhile, by the system
she means to practise with you, and the prejudice
excited by the comparison she'll enable you to
make, from which I shall come off badly. She likes
me, but she'll never like me so much as when she
succeeded a little better in making me look
wretched. For then <i>you'll</i> like me less."

She thinks I have a certain level of decency and that I’ll want to improve my situation before I pressure you into sharing your money. That amount of time is helpful to her, if she doesn't ruin her chances by treating me poorly. Also, Densher continued, "she really doesn't want to treat me badly. I honestly believe, and it may sound strange, that she actually likes me, and if you weren’t involved, I might almost become her favorite young man. She values intelligence and culture – quite the opposite; she wants them around her and mentioned in her social circle. I'm sure it's sometimes been a real problem for her that I'm so appealing, yet so unavailable." He paused, and his companion noticed a peculiar smile on his face, as unusual as the revelation he was offering her. "I suspect she actually believes that, if the truth were known, she likes me, deep down, more than *you* do. So, she's flattering me by thinking I can be trusted to ruin my own chances. That's where her wiggle room is. I'm not the kind of romantic figure that lasts, that withstands the test of time, that remains desirable after familiarity.

"Yes, aren't they?" the girl returned; and they
had, over all that aspect of their wonderful lady,
one of those deep and free interchanges that made
everything but confidence a false note for them.
There were complications, there were questions;
but they were so much more together than they
were anything else. Kate uttered for a while no
word of refutation of Aunt Maud's "big" diplomacy,
and they left it there, as they would have left
any other fine product, for a monument to her
powers. But, Densher related further, he had had
in other respects too the car of Juggernaut to face;
he omitted nothing from his account of his visit,
least of all the way Aunt Maud had frankly at last—though
indeed only under artful pressure—fallen
foul of his very type, his want of the right marks,
his foreign accidents, his queer antecedents. She
had told him he was but half a Briton, which, he
granted Kate, would have been dreadful if he hadn't
so let himself in for it.

He described his visit in detail, especially how Aunt Maud had finally and honestly—though only after some clever prodding—criticized him, his lack of the right social standing, his foreign background, and his past.

"Ah, yes, we must please her personally!" his
companion echoed; and the words may represent
all their definite recognition, at the time, of Densher's
politic gain. They had in fact between this
and his start for New York many matters to handle,
and the question he now touched upon came
up for Kate above all. She looked at him as if he
had really told her aunt more of his immediate personal
story than he had ever told herself. That,
if it were so, was an accident, and it put him, for
half an hour, on as much of the picture of his early
years abroad, his migratory parents, his Swiss
schools, his German university, as she had easy
attention for. A man, he intimated, a man of their
world, would have spotted him straight as to many
of these points; a man of their world, so far as
they had a world, would have been through the
English mill. But it was none the less charming
to make his confession to a woman; women had,
in fact, for such differences, so much more imagination.
Kate showed at present all his case could require;
when she had had it from beginning to end
she declared that she now made out more than ever
yet of what she loved him for. She had herself,
as a child, lived with some continuity in the world
across the Channel, coming home again still a child;
and had participated after that, in her teens, in her
mother's brief but repeated retreats to Dresden, to
Florence, to Biarritz, weak and expensive attempts
at economy from which there stuck to her—though
in general coldly expressed, through the instinctive
avoidance of cheap raptures—the religion of foreign
things. When it was revealed to her how
many more foreign things were in Merton Densher
than he had hitherto taken the trouble to catalogue,
she almost faced him as if he were a map of the
continent or a handsome present of a delightful
new "Murray." He hadn't meant to swagger, he
had rather meant to plead, though with Mrs. Lowder
he had meant also a little to explain. His
father had been, in strange countries, in twenty settlements
of the English, British chaplain, resident
or occasional, and had had for years the unusual
luck of never wanting a billet. His career abroad
had therefore been unbroken, and, as his stipend
had never been great, he had educated his children
at the smallest cost, in the schools nearest; which
was also a saving of railway fares. Densher's
mother, it further appeared, had practised on her
side a distinguished industry, to the success of which—so
far as success ever crowned it—this period of
exile had much contributed: she copied, patient
lady, famous pictures in great museums, having
begun with a happy natural gift and taking in betimes
the scale of her opportunity. Copyists abroad
of course swarmed, but Mrs. Densher had had a
sense and a hand of her own, had arrived at a perfection
that persuaded, that even deceived, and that
made the disposal of her work blissfully usual. Her
son, who had lost her, held her image sacred, and
the effect of his telling Kate all about her, as well
as about other matters until then mixed and dim,
was to render his history rich, his sources full, his
outline anything but common. He had come
round, he had come back, he insisted abundantly, to
being a Briton: his Cambridge years, his happy
connection, as it had proved, with his father's college,
amply certified to that, to say nothing of his
subsequent plunge into London, which filled up
the measure. But brave enough though his descent
to English earth, he had passed, by the way, through
zones of air that had left their ruffle on his wings,
had been exposed to initiations ineffaceable. Something
had happened to him that could never be
undone.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Oh yes, we definitely need to keep her happy!" his friend agreed. Those words probably summarized their immediate understanding of the strategic advantage Densher had gained. They had a lot to deal with before he left for New York, and the situation he was discussing now was primarily relevant to Kate. She looked at him as if he'd revealed more about his personal history to her aunt than he'd ever shared with her. If that was the case, it was unintentional, and it led him to describe his early years abroad—his nomadic parents, his Swiss schools, his German university—for about half an hour, to the extent that she was interested. He suggested that someone from their social circle would immediately recognize those aspects of his background, someone who had gone through the established English education system. However, it was still enjoyable to confide in a woman; women, in his experience, had a greater capacity for understanding those kinds of differences. Kate showed the appropriate level of interest, and after hearing the whole story, she said she now understood even more why she loved him. She herself had spent time living in Europe as a child, returning to England while still young. Later, during her teens, she had joined her mother on several short trips to places like Dresden, Florence, and Biarritz. These were financially limited attempts at travel, but they instilled in her—although she generally avoided expressing excessive enthusiasm—a fondness for foreign cultures. When she realized how many more foreign influences there were in Merton Densher than he'd previously mentioned, she almost looked at him as if he were a map of Europe or an appealing new "Murray's Guidebook." He hadn't intended to boast; he'd actually wanted to explain himself, though he had also wanted to provide some context for Mrs. Lowder. His father had been a British chaplain in various foreign locations, both as a resident and on occasion, and had been fortunate enough to have a consistent income for many years. His career abroad was therefore continuous, and since his salary wasn't high, he educated his children in the most affordable schools nearby, which also saved money on transportation. Densher's mother had also been remarkably industrious. Her success—to the extent that she achieved it—was largely due to this period of living abroad. She was a patient woman who copied famous paintings in major museums, using a natural talent and recognizing the opportunities available to her. Copyists were common abroad, but Mrs. Densher had skill and artistry, achieving a level of perfection that was convincing, even deceptive, and made selling her work easy. His son, who had lost her, cherished her memory, and the effect of telling Kate all this about her, as well as about other things previously vague and unclear, was to make his background richer, his origins more interesting, and his story anything but ordinary. He had become a true Briton again, he insisted repeatedly; his time at Cambridge, and his fortunate association with his father's college, proved that, not to mention his subsequent immersion in London life, which completed the process. Although he was fully English now, he had also experienced influences that left their mark on him, exposures that would never be erased. Something had happened to him that could never be undone.</i></p></div>

When Kate Croy said to him as much he besought
her not to insist, declaring that this indeed
was what was too much the matter with him, that
he had been but too probably spoiled for native, for
insular use. On which, not unnaturally, she insisted
the more, assuring him, without mitigation, that if
he was complicated and brilliant she wouldn't for
the world have had him any thing less; so that he
was reduced in the end to accusing her of putting
the dreadful truth to him in the hollow guise of
flattery. She was making out how abnormal he was
in order that she might eventually find him impossible;
and, as she could fully make it out but
with his aid, she had to bribe him by feigned delight
to help her. If her last word for him, in the
connection, was that the way he saw himself was
just a precious proof the more of his having tasted
of the tree and being thereby prepared to assist her
to eat, this gives the happy tone of their whole
talk, the measure of the flight of time in the near
presence of his settled departure. Kate showed,
however, that she was to be more literally taken
when she spoke of the relief Aunt Maud would draw
from the prospect of his absence.

Naturally, she pushed harder, telling him flatly that she wouldn't want him any other way if he wasn't complex and fascinating. He ended up accusing her of using flattery to tell him the awful truth. She was painting him as abnormal so she could eventually reject him. Since she couldn't fully understand it without his help, she was trying to trick him into helping by pretending to be pleased. When she finally said that his self-awareness was just proof that he'd "tasted of the tree" and was ready to help her "eat," that perfectly captured the lighthearted tone of their entire conversation, and showed how quickly time was passing before he left. However, Kate also proved she was being serious when she mentioned how relieved Aunt Maud would be when he was gone.</i></p></div>

He went on with that fantasy, but at this point
Kate ceased to attend. He saw after a little that
she had been following some thought of her own,

The beauty was in everything, and he could have
separated nothing—couldn't have thought of her
face as distinct from the whole joy. Yet her face
had a new light. "And I pledge you—I call God
to witness!—every spark of my faith; I give you
every drop of my life." That was all, for the moment,
but it was enough, and it was almost as quiet
as if it were nothing. They were in the open air,
in an alley of the Gardens; the great space, which
seemed to arch just then higher and spread wider
for them, threw them back into deep concentration.
They moved by a common instinct to a spot,
within sight, that struck them as fairly sequestered,
and there, before their time together was spent,
they had extorted from concentration every advance
it could make them. They had exchanged
vows and tokens, sealed their rich compact, solemnized,
so far as breathed words and murmured sounds
and lighted eyes and clasped hands could do it, their
agreement to belong only, and to belong tremendously,
to each other. They were to leave the place
accordingly an affianced couple; but before they
left it other things still had passed. Densher had
declared his horror of bringing to a premature end
her happy relation with her aunt; and they had
worked round together to a high level of wisdom
and patience. Kate's free profession was that she
wished not to deprive <i>him</i> of Mrs. Lowder's countenance,
which, in the long run, she was convinced
he would continue to enjoy; and as, by a blessed
turn, Aunt Maud had demanded of him no promise
that would tie his hands, they should be able to
cultivate their destiny in their own way and yet remain
loyal. One difficulty alone stood out, which
Densher named.

They were outside, in a path in the Gardens; the vast space seemed to arch higher and spread wider just for them, drawing them into deep focus.

They had exchanged promises and gifts, sealed their agreement, and declared, with their words and whispers and shining eyes and clasped hands, that they were committed to belonging to each other completely. They were to leave the Gardens as an engaged couple; but before they left, other things had happened. Densher had said he didn't want to ruin her happy relationship with her aunt, and they had worked things out together with great understanding and patience.

silence that looked out for them both at the far

they thus took final possession of it. They were
