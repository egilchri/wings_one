<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Kate Croy waits in her father's shabby lodgings. While waiting, she moves between the sofa and an armchair, looks at the prints on the wall, and stands on the balcony. She also looks at her reflection in a mirror over the mantel, readjusting her hat and hair.</p><p>Her father, Lionel Croy, eventually enters. He says he has been to the chemist because he is unwell. Kate tells him he looks well and then says she is willing to go away and live with him. He expresses surprise and refuses her offer.</p><p>Kate explains that her Aunt Maud has made her a proposal with one condition: that Kate must break off all contact with her father. In response, Kate has come to him. Mr. Croy says this is a proper requirement from her aunt and advises Kate to accept the offer. He tells her she should use him to get a better deal from her aunt, suggesting she make her aunt feel how much of a sacrifice it is to give him up. He advises her to marry a man her aunt selects, after which he will resume relations with her.</p><p>Kate again offers to choose him over her aunt and asks him to stand with her. He refuses, calls her sick, and accuses her of being in love with someone her aunt disapproves of. He opens the door for her to leave. He asks who the man is, and Kate replies that the man wants to be kind to him. Mr. Croy forbids her from marrying anyone her aunt disapproves of and threatens to make her regret it if she defies them. Kate says she is not afraid of him.</p><p>He gives her his final advice and reveals his anger that she gives half of her inheritance to her sister, Marian, instead of to him.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study.</p><p>### Kate Croy</p><p>Kate is introduced in a state of controlled impatience and disgust with her surroundings, which she sees as a direct reflection of her family’s “failure of fortune and of honour.” She is presented as proud, self-aware, and resilient; while observing the shabby room, she also observes her own handsome reflection in the mirror, affirming her personal value as separate from her family's collapse.</p><p>Her situation shifts due to an ultimatum from her Aunt Maud: she will be taken care of financially if she completely severs ties with her father. In response, Kate makes a decisive move, coming to her father not to abandon him but to offer to live with him and reject her aunt’s proposal. When he refuses, deducing she is in love with someone her aunt disapproves of, her situation shifts again. She is left isolated, rejected by the father she offered to save, and must now proceed alone.</p><p>### Lionel Croy (The Father)</p><p>Mr. Croy is presented through his absence and deception before he even appears. He has lied about being ill and inhabits a "vulgar" space that belies his appearance. When he enters, he is a man of profound contradictions: physically immaculate, charming, and looking the part of a "perfectly" respectable English gentleman, yet he is entirely untrustworthy, manipulative, and amoral. He "dealt out lies" and his polished exterior serves to mask his inner corruption.</p><p>His situation is immediately challenged by Kate’s unexpected offer. His initial plan was to make a grand, noble show of sacrificing her for her own good. When she preempts this, he is momentarily "disconcerted" but quickly pivots. His shift is from feigned parental concern to that of a cynical strategist, advising Kate to leverage her "duty" to him to get a better financial deal from her aunt. He ultimately rejects Kate’s genuine appeal for solidarity, revealing his core motivation is not parental feeling but resentment that she gave her inheritance money to her sister instead of to him.</p>

She waited, Kate Croy, for her father to come
in, but he kept her unconscionably, and there
were moments at which she showed herself, in the
glass over the mantel, a face positively pale with
the irritation that had brought her to the point of
going away without sight of him. It was at this
point, however, that she remained; changing her
place, moving from the shabby sofa to the armchair
upholstered in a glazed cloth that gave at
once—she had tried it—the sense of the slippery and
of the sticky. She had looked at the sallow prints
on the walls and at the lonely magazine, a year old,
that combined, with a small lamp in coloured glass
and a knitted white centre-piece wanting in freshness,
to enhance the effect of the purplish cloth on
the principal table; she had above all, from time to
time, taken a brief stand on the small balcony to
which the pair of long windows gave access. The
vulgar little street, in this view, offered scant relief
from the vulgar little room; its main office was to
suggest to her that the narrow black house-fronts,
adjusted to a standard that would have been low
even for backs, constituted quite the publicity implied
by such privacies. One felt them in the room
exactly as one felt the room—the hundred like it
or worse—in the street. Each time she turned in
again, each time, in her impatience, she gave him
up, it was to sound to a deeper depth, while she
tasted the faint, flat emanation of things, the failure
of fortune and of honour. If she continued to wait
it was really, in a manner, that she might not add
the shame of fear, of individual, personal collapse,
to all the other shames. To feel the street, to feel
the room, to feel the table-cloth and the centre-piece
and the lamp, gave her a small, salutary sense, at
least, of neither shirking nor lying. This whole
vision was the worst thing yet—as including, in particular,
the interview for which she had prepared
herself; and for what had she come but for the
worst? She tried to be sad, so as not to be angry;
but it made her angry that she couldn't be sad. And
yet where was misery, misery too beaten for blame
and chalk-marked by fate like a "lot" at a common
auction, if not in these merciless signs of mere
mean, stale feelings?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate Croy waited for her father to come in, but he was taking an unreasonably long time. At moments, she saw her own face in the mirror above the fireplace, and it was visibly pale with the frustration that had almost made her leave without seeing him. However, she stayed. She changed positions, moving from the worn sofa to an armchair covered in a slick, glazed fabric that felt both slippery and sticky – she’d already tested it. She’d looked at the dull prints on the walls, and the lonely, year-old magazine, which, along with a small colored-glass lamp and a faded, knitted white doily, only emphasized the dingy purple tablecloth on the main table. Most of all, she’d occasionally stepped onto the small balcony accessible through the long windows. The unpleasant little street outside offered no escape from the unpleasant little room. It mostly made her think that the narrow, black house fronts, built to a standard that would be low even for the back of buildings, were a perfect representation of the hidden lives within. You felt the rooms exactly as you felt the street—filled with hundreds just like it, or worse. Every time she turned back inside, every time she almost gave up on him in her impatience, she sank deeper into despair, tasting the stale, lifeless atmosphere of failure and disgrace. If she kept waiting, it was really so she wouldn't have to add the shame of fear and personal breakdown to all the other problems she was facing. To feel the street, to feel the room, to feel the tablecloth and doily and lamp, at least gave her the small, comforting feeling that she wasn't avoiding the truth or lying to herself. This whole experience was the worst thing yet, especially the meeting she had prepared for. Why else had she come, but for the worst? She tried to be sad, so she wouldn't be angry, but it made her angry that she couldn’t even be sad. And yet, where else could misery be found—misery too battered to complain, marked by fate like a discarded item at a public sale—if not in these unrelenting signs of ordinary, stale feelings?</i></p></div>

<p>
Her father's life, her sister's, her own, that of
her two lost brothers—the whole history of their
house had the effect of some fine florid, voluminous
phrase, say even a musical, that dropped first into
words, into notes, without sense, and then, hanging
unfinished, into no words, no notes at all. Why
should a set of people have been put in motion, on
such a scale and with such an air of being equipped
for a profitable journey, only to break down without
an accident, to stretch themselves in the wayside
dust without a reason? The answer to these questions
was not in Chirk Street, but the questions themselves
bristled there, and the girl's repeated pause
before the mirror and the chimney-place might
have represented her nearest approach to an escape
from them. Was it not in fact the partial escape
from this "worst" in which she was steeped to be
able to make herself out again as agreeable to see?
She stared into the tarnished glass too hard indeed
to be staring at her beauty alone. She readjusted
the poise of her black, closely-feathered hat; retouched,
beneath it, the thick fall of her dusky hair;
kept her eyes, aslant, no less on her beautiful averted
than on her beautiful presented oval. She was
dressed altogether in black, which gave an even
tone, by contrast, to her clear face and made her
hair more harmoniously dark. Outside, on the balcony,
her eyes showed as blue; within, at the mirror,
they showed almost as black. She was handsome,
but the degree of it was not sustained by
items and aids; a circumstance moreover playing
its part at almost any time in the impression she
produced. The impression was one that remained,
but as regards the sources of it no sum in addition
would have made up the total. She had stature
without height, grace without motion, presence
without mass. Slender and simple, frequently
soundless, she was somehow always in the line of
the eye—she counted singularly for its pleasure.
More "dressed," often, with fewer accessories, than
other women, or less dressed, should occasion require,
with more, she probably could not have given
the key to these felicities. They were mysteries of
which her friends were conscious—those friends
whose general explanation was to say that she was
clever, whether or no it were taken by the world as
the cause or as the effect of her charm. If she saw
more things than her fine face in the dull glass of
her father's lodgings, she might have seen that, after
all, she was not herself a fact in the collapse. She
didn't judge herself cheap, she didn't make for
misery. Personally, at least, she was not chalk-marked
for the auction. She hadn't given up yet,
and the broken sentence, if she was the last word,
would end with a sort of meaning. There was a
minute during which, though her eyes were fixed,
she quite visibly lost herself in the thought of the
way she might still pull things round had she only
been a man. It was the name, above all, she would
take in hand—the precious name she so liked and
that, in spite of the harm her wretched father had
done it, was not yet past praying for. She loved it
in fact the more tenderly for that bleeding wound.
But what could a penniless girl do with it but let
it go?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The history of her family—her father's life, her sister's, her own, and that of her two brothers who had died—was like a beautiful, complex story, perhaps even a musical piece. It started with words and notes, full of promise, but then stopped abruptly, never reaching a conclusion. Why had this family been set in motion, with such grand expectations and the appearance of preparing for a successful journey, only to fail without a clear cause, collapsing on the side of the road with no apparent reason?</i></p><p><i>The answer to these questions wasn't to be found on Chirk Street, but the questions themselves were ever-present, haunting her. The girl's frequent moments of contemplation in front of the mirror and the fireplace might have been her closest attempt to escape them. Wasn't it a way to escape the "worst" of her situation to be able to make herself look appealing again? She gazed intently into the tarnished mirror, not just admiring her beauty. She adjusted her black, feathered hat, smoothed her dark hair, and observed both her beautiful profile and the face she presented to the world.</i></p><p><i>She was completely dressed in black, which emphasized her fair complexion and made her hair appear even darker. Her eyes looked blue on the balcony and almost black in the mirror. She was attractive, but her appeal wasn't dependent on any particular features or accessories. This was a significant aspect of the impression she created. The impression remained, but no amount of analysis could fully explain it. She possessed a graceful presence, a strong character, without the obvious physical attributes. She was slender and unassuming, often quiet, but somehow always caught the eye—she was uniquely pleasing to look at. She was often "more dressed" with fewer accessories than other women, or conversely, less dressed with more, but she couldn't explain how she achieved these effects. Her friends were aware of these mysteries, and they generally explained it by saying she was intelligent, whether they believed her intelligence was the cause or the result of her charm.</i></p><p><i>If she saw more than just her pretty face in the dull mirror of her father's home, she might have realized that she wasn't a victim of her family's downfall. She didn't see herself as worthless, and she wasn't consumed by sadness. Personally, at least, she wasn't destined to be ruined. She hadn't given up hope, and if she were the last one standing, the unfinished story would eventually find some resolution. For a moment, her eyes fixed, she lost herself in the thought of how she could still turn things around if she were a man. It was the family name, above all, that she wanted to salvage—the cherished name she loved, which, despite her father's mistakes, could still be redeemed. In fact, she loved it even more tenderly because of its wounded state.</i></p><p><i>But what could a poor girl do with it but let it go?</i></p></div>

When her father at last appeared she became, as
usual, instantly aware of the futility of any effort
to hold him to anything. He had written her that
he was ill, too ill to leave his room, and that he
must see her without delay; and if this had been,
as was probable, the sketch of a design, he was indifferent
even to the moderate finish required for
deception. He had clearly wanted, for perversities
that he called reasons, to see her, just as she herself
had sharpened for a talk; but she now again felt, in
the inevitability of the freedom he used with her,
all the old ache, her poor mother's very own, that
he couldn't touch you ever so lightly without setting
up. No relation with him could be so short
or so superficial as not to be somehow to your hurt;
and this, in the strangest way in the world, not
because he desired it to be—feeling often, as he
surely must, the profit for him of its not being—but
because there was never a mistake for you that
he could leave unmade or a conviction of his impossibility
in you that he could approach you without
strengthening. He might have awaited her on
the sofa in his sitting-room, or might have stayed
in bed and received her in that situation. She was
glad to be spared the sight of such <i>penetralia,</i> but
it would have reminded her a little less that there
was no truth in him. This was the weariness of
every fresh meeting; he dealt out lies as he might
the cards from the greasy old pack for the game
of diplomacy to which you were to sit down with
him. The inconvenience—as always happens in
such cases—was not that you minded what was
false, but that you missed what was true. He might
be ill, and it might suit you to know it, but no contact
with him, for this, could ever be straight enough.
Just so he even might die, but Kate fairly wondered
on what evidence of his own she would some day
have to believe it.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>When her father finally showed up, she immediately realized, as always, how pointless it was to try to pin him down. He'd written that he was sick, too sick to leave his room, and that he needed to see her urgently. If that had been a manipulative ploy—which it probably was—he hadn't even bothered to make it believable. He clearly just wanted to see her, for reasons he considered valid, just as she had been looking forward to a conversation. But now she felt again, in the inescapable way he used her, all the familiar pain, the same kind her poor mother had felt, the way he couldn't even touch you gently without causing a reaction. No interaction with him could be brief or superficial enough to avoid hurting you somehow. And this, strangely, wasn't because he wanted to inflict pain – he probably recognized it would be better for him if it didn’t – but because he couldn't help but make any mistake possible and always reinforced your doubts about him. He could have been waiting for her on the sofa in his living room, or he could have stayed in bed and received her there. She was glad she didn't have to see his inner sanctum, but it would have reminded her less of how untruthful he was. This was the exhaustion of every meeting: he dispensed lies as easily as dealing cards from a dirty old deck for a game of manipulation you were forced to play with him. The problem—as always in these situations—wasn't that you minded the lies, but that you missed the truth. He might be sick, and it might suit her to know it, but no interaction with him, even for this, could ever be straightforward. He might even die, Kate thought, but she wondered what proof she'd ever have to believe it.</i></p></div>

He had not at present come down from his room,
which she knew to be above the one they were in:
he had already been out of the house, though he
would either, should she challenge him, deny it or
present it as a proof of his extremity. She had,
however, by this time, quite ceased to challenge him;
not only, face to face with him, vain irritation
dropped, but he breathed upon the tragic consciousness
in such a way that after a moment nothing of
it was left. The difficulty was not less that he
breathed in the same way upon the comic: she almost
believed that with this latter she might still
have found a foothold for clinging to him. He had
ceased to be amusing—he was really too inhuman.
His perfect look, which had floated him so long, was
practically perfect still; but one had long since for
every occasion taken it for granted. Nothing could
have better shown than the actual how right one
had been. He looked exactly as much as usual—all
pink and silver as to skin and hair, all straitness
and starch as to figure and dress—the man in
the world least connected with anything unpleasant.
He was so particularly the English gentleman and
the fortunate, settled, normal person. Seen at a
foreign <i>table d'hôte,</i> he suggested but one thing:
"In what perfection England produces them!" He
had kind, safe eyes, and a voice which, for all its
clean fulness, told, in a manner, the happy history
of its having never had once to raise itself. Life
had met him so, half-way, and had turned round so
to walk with him, placing a hand in his arm and
fondly leaving him to choose the pace. Those who
knew him a little said, "How he does dress!"—those
who knew him better said, "How <i>does</i> he?"
The one stray gleam of comedy just now in his
daughter's eyes was the funny feeling he momentarily
made her have of being herself "looked up" by
him in sordid lodgings. For a minute after he came
in it was as if the place were her own and he the visitor
with susceptibilities. He gave you funny feelings,
he had indescribable arts, that quite turned the
tables: that had been always how he came to see
her mother so long as her mother would see him.
He came from places they had often not known
about, but he patronised Lexham Gardens. Kate's
only actual expression of impatience, however, was
"I'm glad you're so much better!"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He hadn't come downstairs yet; she knew he was in the room above them. He'd already been outside, although if she confronted him, he would either deny it or present it as evidence of his desperation. However, she'd stopped challenging him entirely. It wasn't just that her anger faded when she was with him, but he had a way of downplaying the painful things in her life so that, after a little while, she forgot about them. The problem was that he also did the same with anything funny or lighthearted; she almost thought she could still connect with him if she focused on that. He wasn't even amusing anymore; he was simply too cold and unfeeling. His flawless appearance, which had served him so well for so long, was still almost perfect, but she'd long since stopped paying attention to it. The reality of the situation just confirmed how right she'd been. He looked exactly the same as always – all pink and silver with his skin and hair, all crispness and formality in his posture and clothes – the most detached and carefree person in the world. He was the epitome of the English gentleman, the fortunate, well-adjusted, and ordinary man. If you saw him at a foreign hotel, you would think, "How perfectly England produces them!" He had kind, reassuring eyes and a voice that, despite its pleasant fullness, clearly showed he'd never had to raise it in any kind of distress. Life had met him halfway, embraced him, and walked with him, offering him its arm and letting him choose the pace. Those who knew him superficially would say, "How well-dressed he is!" – those who knew him better would wonder, "How does he manage?"</i></p><p><i>The only flicker of amusement in his daughter's eyes at that moment was the fleeting sensation he gave her of being "looked up to" by him in their humble lodgings.

He had a way of making you feel ridiculous; he had these strange skills that completely flipped the situation. That's how he had always gotten away with seeing her mother as long as her mother allowed him to. He went to places they didn't know about, but he treated their neighborhood with condescension.

"I'm not so much better, my dear—I'm exceedingly
unwell; the proof of which is, precisely, that
I've been out to the chemist's—that beastly fellow
at the corner." So Mr. Croy showed he could
qualify the humble hand that assuaged him. "I'm

"Oh papa, it's long since I've ceased to see you
otherwise than as you really are! I think we've
all arrived by this time at the right word for that:
'You're beautiful—<i>n'en parlons plus.'</i> You're as
beautiful as ever—you look lovely." He judged
meanwhile her own appearance, as she knew she
could always trust him to do; recognising, estimating,
sometimes disapproving, what she wore, showing
her the interest he continued to take in her. He
might really take none at all, yet she virtually knew
herself the creature in the world to whom he was
least indifferent. She had often enough wondered
what on earth, at the pass he had reached, could
give him pleasure, and she had come back, on these
occasions, to that. It gave him pleasure that she
was handsome, that she was, in her way, a sensible
value. It was at least as marked, nevertheless, that
he derived none from similar conditions, so far as
they <i>were</i> similar, in his other child. Poor Marian
might be handsome, but he certainly didn't care.
The hitch here, of course, was that, with whatever
beauty, her sister, widowed and almost in want, with
four bouncing children, was not a sensible value.
She asked him, the next thing, how long he had been
in his actual quarters, though aware of how little
it mattered, how little any answer he might make
would probably have in common with the truth.
She failed in fact to notice his answer, truthful or
not, already occupied as she was with what she had
on her own side to say to him. This was really what
had made her wait—what superseded the small
remainder of her resentment at his constant practical
impertinence; the result of all of which was that,
within a minute, she had brought it out. "Yes—even
now I'm willing to go with you. I don't know
what you may have wished to say to me, and even
if you hadn't written you would within a day or
two have heard from me. Things have happened,
and I've only waited, for seeing you, till I should be
quite sure. I <i>am</i> quite sure. I'll go with you."

I think we've finally landed on the right word for it: 'You're wonderful – let's not talk about it anymore.' You're still as wonderful as ever—you look great." He was sizing up her appearance at the same time, as she knew he always would; noticing, evaluating, sometimes disapproving of what she was wearing, showing her he still cared about her. He might not actually care, but she knew she was the person in the world he cared about the most. She'd often wondered what could possibly bring him joy at this stage of his life, and she always came back to this: it pleased him that she was attractive, that she was, in her own way, a worthwhile asset. It was also very clear, however, that he didn't get any satisfaction from the same things, as far as they were similar, in his other child.

Lionel Croy hung about in his disengaged way—hovered
there as if, in consequence of her words,
looking for a pretext to back out easily: on which

might be called, what he had himself been preparing.
He wished her not to come to him, still less to
settle with him, and had sent for her to give her
up with some style and state; a part of the beauty
of which, however, was to have been his sacrifice
to her own detachment. There was no style, no
state, unless she wished to forsake him. His idea
had accordingly been to surrender her to her wish
with all nobleness; it had by no means been to have
positively to keep her off. She cared, however, not
a straw for his embarrassment—feeling how little,
on her own part, she was moved by charity. She
had seen him, first and last, in so many attitudes that
she could now deprive him quite without compunction
of the luxury of a new one. Yet she felt the
disconcerted gasp in his tone as he said: "Oh my
child, I can never consent to that!"

But she immediately realized that she’d underestimated something: he was actually planning the same thing. He didn’t want her to come to him, especially not to be with him permanently. He had called her to break things off with some flair and formality. The plan was that part of the elegance of the breakup would be him sacrificing himself for her sake, to make it appear that he was being noble. There was no style or grace unless she was the one who wanted to leave him. His plan had been to gracefully let her have what she wanted, but definitely not to actively push her away. However, she didn’t care at all about his discomfort, because she knew she wasn’t feeling any sympathy herself. She’d seen him in so many different moods that she could now completely disregard his feelings without any guilt. And yet, she noticed the shocked sound in his voice when he said, "Oh my dear, I can never agree to that!"</i></p></div>

Standing before her with his hands behind him
and his legs a little apart, he swayed slightly to and
fro, inclined toward her as if rising on his toes. It
had an effect of conscientious deliberation. "No.
I haven't. I couldn't. I wouldn't." It was so respectable,
a show that she felt afresh, and with the
memory of their old despair, the despair at home,
how little his appearance ever by any chance told
about him. His plausibility had been the heaviest
of her mother's crosses; inevitably so much more
present to the world than whatever it was that was
horrid—thank God they didn't really know!—that
he had done. He had positively been, in his way,
by the force of his particular type, a terrible husband
not to live with; his type reflecting so invidiously
on the woman who had found him distasteful.
Had this thereby not kept directly present to Kate
herself that it might, on some sides, prove no light
thing for her to leave uncompanioned a parent with
such a face and such a manner? Yet if there was
much she neither knew nor dreamed of, it passed
between them at this very moment that he was quite
familiar with himself as the subject of such quandaries.
If he recognised his younger daughter's
happy aspect as a sensible value, he had from the
first still more exactly appraised his own. The great
wonder was not that in spite of everything his own
had helped him; the great wonder was that it hadn't
helped him more. However, it was, to its old,
eternal, recurrent tune, helping him all the while;
her drop into patience with him showed how it
was helping him at this moment. She saw the next
instant precisely the line he would take. "Do you
really ask me to believe you've been making up your
mind to that?"

He leaned towards her, as if he were about to stand on his toes. It gave the impression of careful consideration. "No. I haven't. I couldn't. I wouldn't." His respectable facade, something she was keenly aware of, reminded her of their past struggles, of the hopelessness at home, and how little his outward appearance ever revealed about the true man. His charm had been a great burden to her mother. It was always more visible to the outside world than whatever terrible things he had done—thank God no one truly knew! He had, in his own way and due to his personality, been a terrible husband to live with. His very nature reflected poorly on the woman who found him repulsive.</i></p><p><i>Hadn't this constantly reminded Kate that leaving her father, with his face and manner, alone might not be easy for her? Even though there was much she didn't know or understand, they both understood at this moment that he was well aware of how he was a source of these kinds of questions. While he acknowledged that his younger daughter’s happiness was valuable, he had from the beginning had an even more exact understanding of his own. The real surprise wasn't that his own personality had helped him; the real surprise was that it hadn't helped him more. However, it was, with its old, familiar, and recurring tune, still helping him. Kate’s acceptance of his presence demonstrated how it was helping him at this moment. She immediately knew exactly what he would say next.

"Then, my dear girl, you ought simply to be
ashamed of yourself. Do you know what you're
a proof of, all you hard, hollow people together?"
He put the question with a charming air of sudden
spiritual heat. "Of the deplorably superficial morality
of the age. The family sentiment, in our vulgarised,
brutalised life, has gone utterly to pot.
There was a day when a man like me—by which
I mean a parent like me—would have been for a
daughter like you a quite distinct value; what's
called in the business world, I believe, an 'asset.'"
He continued sociably to make it out. "I'm not
talking only of what you might, with the right
feeling do <i>for</i> me, but of what you might—it's what
I call your opportunity—do <i>with</i> me. Unless indeed,"
he the next moment imperturbably threw off,
"they come a good deal to the same thing. Your
duty as well as your chance, if you're capable of
seeing it, is to use me. Show family feeling by
seeing what I'm good for. If you had it as <i>I</i> have
it you'd see I'm still good—well, for a lot of things.
There's in fact, my dear," Mr. Croy wound up,
"a coach-and-four to be got out of me." His
drop, or rather his climax, failed a little of effect,
indeed, through an undue precipitation of memory.
Something his daughter had said came back to him.
"You've settled to give away half your little inheritance?"

He asked this with a sudden burst of enthusiasm, as if he'd just found religion. "You're proof of how shallow and worthless our morals have become. Family loyalty, in this crude, heartless world, is completely gone. There was a time when a man like me—a father like me—would have been a significant advantage for a daughter like you; a real 'asset,' as they say in the business world."</i></p><p><i>He went on, friendly as could be, explaining himself. "I'm not just talking about what you could do *for* me, but what you could do *with* me – that's your chance, your opportunity. Unless," he added casually, "they amount to pretty much the same thing. Your duty, and your chance, if you have any sense, is to use me. Show your family feeling by figuring out what I'm good for. If you understood the situation the way I do, you'd see I'm still valuable – good for a lot of things. The truth is, dear," Mr. Croy concluded, "you can get a great deal out of me." His dramatic finale, however, wasn't quite as impressive as he hoped, because his memory kicked in a little too quickly. Something his daughter had said earlier came back to him.

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>After her mother’s death, a young woman went to live with her wealthy aunt, Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud). While living in her aunt’s house, she discovered she enjoyed material comforts. She also discovered that her aunt had long been concerned about her family. The young woman, Kate, spent much of her time alone in her room, feeling pressure from her aunt and postponing a "surrender" to her.</p><p>Kate visited her sister, Marian, a widow with four children. During the visit, which took place in Marian's home after the children’s dinner, Marian told Kate not to "throw herself away." Marian explained that she was afraid Kate would marry Merton Densher, whom she dislikes for having no money. Marian insisted that Kate must marry for money and do what their Aunt Maud wants.</p><p>Kate replied that their father had told her the same thing the previous day. She then revealed that she had visited their father and offered to go live with him. Marian reacted with horror. Kate explained that their father had refused her offer, believing she should stay with Aunt Maud and threatening to curse her if she left.</p><p>As Kate was leaving, she asked whom Marian meant by "Aunt Maud's young man." Marian named Lord Mark. Kate dismissed this as gossip. To end the conversation, they agreed that Marian would stop mentioning Lord Mark as long as Kate assured her she was not involved with anyone else. Kate denied everything and left.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Kate is presented as an intelligent, observant, and deeply conflicted young woman whose situation has shifted dramatically. Forced by her mother's death and financial ruin to live with her wealthy aunt, she is acutely aware of her new dependence. She is introspective, analyzing her own surprising susceptibility to the material comforts her aunt provides, while also feeling trapped and scrutinized. She views herself as a "trembling kid" before the "lioness" Aunt Maud, and feels a burdensome, resentful duty toward her sister. She hides her true thoughts from others, often accepting their interpretations of her actions to maintain peace, a state she sees as a "hypocrisy of stupidity."
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
Presented entirely through Kate's perception, Aunt Maud is a formidable and powerful figure. She is physically described as "majestic" and "magnificent," but her personality is seen as "sharp," controlling, and possessing a "strong will." Kate views her as a "lioness" and a "besieger," a complex and "unscrupulous" force who is both "passionate" and "practical." In the past, she maintained a calculated distance from Kate's family, offering just enough to create a sense of grievance. Now, having taken Kate in, her influence is an immense, looming pressure that dictates Kate's options.
<li>*Marian Condrip**</li></ul>
Kate’s elder sister, Marian, is presented as a woman diminished by circumstance. A "demoralised, querulous" widow with children, she has lost her youthful charm and become, in Kate’s eyes, selfish and manipulative. Her situation is one of financial desperation, and she relentlessly pressures Kate to secure their aunt’s fortune for the family’s benefit. She is fixated on Kate making a strategic marriage and is openly hostile to any prospect, like Merton Densher, who lacks money. Her perspective is portrayed as vulgar and "abject," shaped by her unhappy marriage and the influence of her late husband's family.

<p>
She had gone to Mrs. Lowder on her mother's
death—gone with an effort the strain and pain of
which made her at present, as she recalled them,
reflect on the long way she had travelled since then.
There had been nothing else to do—not a penny
in the other house, nothing but unpaid bills that had
gathered thick while its mistress lay mortally ill,
and the admonition that there was nothing she must
attempt to raise money on, since everything belonged
to the "estate." How the estate would turn
out at best presented itself as a mystery altogether
gruesome; it had proved, in fact, since then a residuum
a trifle less scant than, with Marian, she had for
some weeks feared; but the girl had had at the beginning
rather a wounded sense of its being watched
on behalf of Marian and her children. What on
earth was it supposed that <i>she</i> wanted to do to it?
She wanted in truth only to give up—to abandon her
own interest, which she, no doubt, would already
have done had not the point been subject to Aunt
Maud's sharp intervention. Aunt Maud's intervention
was all sharp now, and the other point, the
great one, was that it was to be, in this light, either
all put up with or all declined. Yet at the winter's
end, nevertheless, she could scarce have said what
stand she conceived she had taken. It wouldn't be
the first time she had seen herself obliged to accept
with smothered irony other people's interpretation
of her conduct. She often ended by giving up to
them—it seemed really the way to live—the version
that met their convenience.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>After her mother died, she went to Mrs. Lowder. Remembering the effort and pain that took, she realized how much she'd changed since then. She had no other options—no money in her childhood home, just unpaid bills that piled up while her mother was dying. And she was told not to try to borrow money, because everything was tied up in the "estate." How that estate would work out was a scary mystery. In the end, it turned out to be a little more than she had feared, but at first she felt like someone was watching her, possibly to protect Marian and her children. What did they think she was going to do with it? Really, she just wanted to give up—to forget about her own interests. She probably would have, too, if Aunt Maud hadn't interfered so sharply. Aunt Maud’s intervention was always harsh. The main issue was that she had to either accept everything, or reject it all. Still, by the end of winter, she wasn't sure what her actual position was. It wouldn't be the first time she’d been forced to accept other people's views of her actions, doing it with a hidden smile. She often gave in to them – it felt like the only way to get by – and went along with the version that suited them best.</i></p></div>

<p>
The tall, rich, heavy house at Lancaster Gate, on
the other side of the Park and the long South Kensington
stretches, had figured to her, through childhood,
through girlhood, as the remotest limit of her
vague young world. It was further off and more
occasional than anything else in the comparatively
compact circle in which she revolved, and seemed,
by a rigour early marked, to be reached through
long, straight, discouraging vistas, which kept
lengthening and straightening, whereas almost
everything else in life was either, at the worst, round
about Cromwell Road, or, at the furthest, in the
nearer parts of Kensington Gardens. Mrs. Lowder
was her only "real" aunt, not the wife of an uncle,
and had been thereby, both in ancient days and when
the greater trouble came, the person, of all persons,
properly to make some sign; in accord with which
our young woman's feeling was founded on the impression,
quite cherished for years, that the signs
made across the interval just mentioned had never
been really in the note of the situation. The main
office of this relative, for the young Croys—apart
from giving them their fixed measure of social greatness—had
struck them as being to form them to a
conception of what they were not to expect. When
Kate came to think matters over with the aid of
knowledge, she failed quite to see how Aunt Maud
could have been different—she had rather perceived
by this time how many other things might have
been; yet she also made out that if they had all consciously
lived under a liability to the chill breath of
<i>ultima Thule</i> they couldn't, either, on the facts, very
well have done less. What in the event appeared
established was that if Mrs. Lowder had disliked
them she had yet not disliked them so much as they
supposed. It had at any rate been for the purpose
of showing how she struggled with her aversion
that she sometimes came to see them, that she at
regular periods invited them to her house, and in
short, as it now looked, kept them along on the
terms that would best give her sister the perennial
luxury of a grievance. This sister, poor Mrs. Croy,
the girl knew, had always judged her resentfully,
and had brought them up, Marian, the boys and
herself, to the idea of a particular attitude, for signs
of the practice of which they watched each other
with awe. The attitude was to make plain to Aunt
Maud, with the same regularity as her invitations,
that they sufficed—thanks awfully—to themselves.
But the ground of it, Kate lived to discern, was that
this was only because <i>she</i> didn't suffice to them. The
little she offered was to be accepted under protest,
yet not, really, because it was excessive. It wounded
them—there was the rub!—because it fell short.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>As a child and young woman, the imposing, wealthy home on Lancaster Gate, across the park and the long South Kensington area, seemed to Kate to be the furthest point in her limited world. It was more distant and less frequently visited than anything else in the relatively small world she moved in. Reaching it seemed to involve long, straight, and discouraging paths that always seemed to stretch further, while everything else in her life was either close to Cromwell Road or, at most, in the nearby Kensington Gardens. Mrs. Lowder, her only "real" aunt (not just an aunt by marriage), should have been the one to offer help, both in the past and when serious difficulties arose. Kate had long believed that the gestures Mrs. Lowder made across that distance never truly addressed the situation. Aside from giving the young Croys a sense of their social standing, Mrs. Lowder's main role, as they saw it, was to shape their expectations by showing them what they shouldn't hope for. When Kate later reflected on the situation with more understanding, she couldn't see how Aunt Maud could have acted differently – instead, she realized how many other things could have happened. However, she also understood that if they had all lived under the threat of utter rejection, they couldn't have realistically expected less. The established truth was that even if Mrs. Lowder disliked them, she hadn't disliked them as much as they'd thought. In fact, her visits and regular invitations, and everything she did, seemed designed to show her struggle with her aversion. She kept them around on terms that allowed her sister, Mrs. Croy, to perpetually feel aggrieved. Kate knew that her mother had always judged her resentfully and had raised them to adopt a specific attitude, and they all nervously watched each other to see if they were fulfilling the role. That attitude was designed to show Aunt Maud, as consistently as her invitations, that they were perfectly fine on their own, thank you very much. But Kate later realized the real reason for this was that they *weren't* fine on their own. They were supposed to accept what little she offered with reluctance, not because it was too much, but because it wasn't enough. That's what hurt them.</i></p></div>

The number of new things our young lady looked
out on from the high south window that hung over
the Park—this number was so great (though some
of the things were only old ones altered and, as
the phrase was of other matters, done up), that life
at present turned to her view from week to week
more and more the face of a striking and distinguished
stranger. She had reached a great age—for
it quite seemed to her that at twenty-five it was
late to reconsider; and her most general sense was
a shade of regret that she had not known earlier.
The world was different—whether for worse or for
better—from her rudimentary readings, and it gave
her the feeling of a wasted past. If she had only
known sooner she might have arranged herself more
to meet it. She made, at all events, discoveries
every day, some of which were about herself and
others about other persons. Two of these—one
under each head—more particularly engaged, in
alternation, her anxiety. She saw as she had never
seen before how material things spoke to her. She
saw, and she blushed to see, that if, in contrast with
some of its old aspects, life now affected her as a
dress successfully "done up," this was exactly by
reason of the trimmings and lace, was a matter of
ribbons and silk and velvet. She had a dire accessibility
to pleasure from such sources. She liked
the charming quarters her aunt had assigned her—liked
them literally more than she had in all her
other days liked anything; and nothing could have
been more uneasy than her suspicion of her relative's
view of this truth. Her relative was prodigious—she
had never done her relative justice. These
larger conditions all tasted of her, from morning
till night; but she was a person in respect to whom
the growth of acquaintance could only—strange as
it might seem—keep your heart in your mouth.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>From the tall window overlooking the park, our young woman observed so many new things (though some were just old things that had been changed or "dressed up"), that her life seemed more and more like an impressive and unfamiliar person. She felt old, considering she was already twenty-five, and she regretted not understanding these things sooner. The world was different than she had previously understood, and she felt like she’d wasted her past. If she'd known earlier, she might have better prepared herself. She discovered something new every day, some about herself and some about others. Two of these discoveries, one about herself and one about someone else, occupied her thoughts. She realized how much material things appealed to her. She blushed to admit that if life now felt appealing, like a well-dressed gown, it was because of the pretty decorations. She was terribly susceptible to pleasure from those kinds of things. She loved the lovely rooms her aunt had given her, literally more than she'd ever liked anything else; and she felt uneasy suspecting her aunt knew this. Her aunt was amazing—she had never fully appreciated her. Her aunt's influence touched everything in her life.

The girl's second great discovery was that, so
far from having been for Mrs. Lowder a subject of
superficial consideration, the blighted home in Lexham
Gardens had haunted her nights and her days.
Kate had spent, all winter, hours of observation that
were not less pointed for being spent alone; recent
events, which her mourning explained, assured her
a measure of isolation, and it was in the isolation
above all that her neighbour's influence worked.
Sitting far downstairs Aunt Maud was yet a presence
from which a sensitive niece could feel herself
extremely under pressure. She knew herself now,
the sensitive niece, as having been marked from far
back. She knew more than she could have told you,
by the upstairs fire, in a whole dark December afternoon.
She knew so much that her knowledge was
what fairly kept her there, making her at times
more endlessly between the small silk-covered sofa
that stood for her in the firelight and the great grey
map of Middlesex spread beneath her lookout. To
go down, to forsake her refuge, was to meet some
of her discoveries half-way, to have to face them
or fly before them; whereas they were at such a
height only like the rumble of a far-off siege heard
in the provisioned citadel. She had almost liked,
in these weeks, what had created her suspense and
her stress: the loss of her mother, the submersion
of her father, the discomfort of her sister, the confirmation
of their shrunken prospects, the certainty,
in especial, of her having to recognise that, should
she behave, as she called it, decently—that is still
do something for others—she would be herself
wholly without supplies. She held that she had a
right to sadness and stillness; she nursed them for
their postponing power. What they mainly postponed
was the question of a surrender—though she
could not yet have said exactly of what: a general
surrender of everything—that was at moments the
way it presented itself—to Aunt Maud's looming
"personality." It was by her personality that Aunt
Maud was prodigious, and the great mass of it
loomed because, in the thick, the foglike air of her
arranged existence, there were parts doubtless magnified
and parts certainly vague. They represented
at all events alike, the dim and the distinct, a strong
will and a high hand. It was perfectly present to
Kate that she might be devoured, and she likened
herself to a trembling kid, kept apart a day or two
till her turn should come, but sure sooner or later to
be introduced into the cage of the lioness.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The girl's second major realization was that Mrs. Lowder hadn't just given a passing thought to the situation; the troubled household in Lexham Gardens had become an obsession for her.

She believed she had a right to sadness and stillness; she clung to them because they delayed things. What they mainly postponed was the question of surrender – though she couldn't yet say exactly what she would be surrendering: everything, perhaps. That was how it felt at times, a surrender to Aunt Maud's overwhelming "personality."

<div class="original-text">
<p>
The cage was Aunt Maud's own room, her office,
her counting-house, her battlefield, her especial
scene, in fine, of action, situated on the ground-floor,
opening from the main hall and figuring rather to
our young woman on exit and entrance as a guard
house or a toll-gate. The lioness waited—the kid
had at least that consciousness; was aware of the
neighbourhood of a morsel she had reason to suppose
tender. She would have been meanwhile a
wonderful lioness for a show, an extraordinary figure
in a cage or anywhere; majestic, magnificent,
high-coloured, all brilliant gloss, perpetual satin,
twinkling bugles and flashing gems, with a lustre
of agate eyes, a sheen of raven hair, a polish of
complexion that was like that of well-kept china
and that—as if the skin were too tight—told especially
at curves and corners. Her niece had a quiet
name for her—she kept it quiet; thinking of her,
with a free fancy, as somehow typically insular, she
talked to herself of Britannia of the Market Place—Britannia
unmistakable, but with a pen in her
ear, and felt she should not be happy till she might
on some occasion add to the rest of the panoply
a helmet, a shield, a trident and a ledger. It was
not in truth, however, that the forces with which,
as Kate felt, she would have to deal were those
most suggested by an image simple and broad; she
was learning, after all, each day, to know her companion,
and what she had already most perceived
was the mistake of trusting to easy analogies.
There was a whole side of Britannia, the side of
her florid philistinism, her plumes and her train,
her fantastic furniture and heaving bosom, the false
gods of her taste and false notes of her talk, the
sole contemplation of which would be dangerously
misleading. She was a complex and subtle Britannia,
as passionate as she was practical, with a reticule
for her prejudices as deep as that other pocket,
the pocket full of coins stamped in her image, that
the world best knew her by. She carried on, in
short, behind her aggressive and defensive front,
operations determined by her wisdom. It was in
fact, we have hinted, as a besieger that our young
lady, in the provisioned citadel, had for the present
most to think of her, and what made her formidable
in this character was that she was unscrupulous and
immoral. So, at all events, in silent sessions and
a youthful off-hand way, Kate conveniently pictured
her: what this sufficiently represented being that
her weight was in the scale of certain dangers—those
dangers that, by our showing, made the
younger woman linger and lurk above, while the
elder, below, both militant and diplomatic, covered
as much of the ground as possible. Yet what were
the dangers, after all, but just the dangers of life
and of London? Mrs. Lowder <i>was</i> London, <i>was</i>
life—the roar of the siege and the thick of the fray.
There were some things, after all, of which Britannia
was afraid; but Aunt Maud was afraid of nothing—not
even, it would appear, of arduous thought.
These impressions, none the less, Kate kept so
much to herself that she scarce shared them with
poor Marian, the ostensible purpose of her frequent
visits to whom yet continued to be to talk
over everything. One of her reasons for holding
off from the last concession to Aunt Maud was that
she might be the more free to commit herself to
this so much nearer and so much less fortunate
relative, with whom Aunt Maud would have, directly,
almost nothing to do. The sharpest pinch
of her state, meanwhile, was exactly that all intercourse
with her sister had the effect of casting
down her courage and tying her hands, adding daily
to her sense of the part, not always either uplifting
or sweetening, that the bond of blood might play
in one's life. She was face to face with it now, with
the bond of blood; the consciousness of it was
what she seemed most clearly to have "come into"
by the death of her mother, much of that consciousness
as her mother had absorbed and carried away.
Her haunting, harrassing father, her menacing, uncompromising
aunt, her portionless little nephews
and nieces, were figures that caused the chord of
natural piety superabundantly to vibrate. Her manner
of putting it to herself—but more especially
in respect to Marian—was that she saw what you
might be brought to by the cultivation of consanguinity.
She had taken, in the old days, as she
supposed, the measure of this liability; those being
the days when, as the second-born, she had thought
no one in the world so pretty as Marian, no one
so charming, so clever, so assured, in advance, of
happiness and success. The view was different
now, but her attitude had been obliged, for many
reasons, to show as the same. The subject of this
estimate was no longer pretty, as the reason for
thinking her clever was no longer plain; yet, bereaved,
disappointed, demoralised, querulous, she
was all the more sharply and insistently Kate's elder
and Kate's own. Kate's most constant feeling
about her was that she would make her, Kate,
do things; and always, in comfortless Chelsea,
at the door of the small house the small rent of
which she couldn't help having on her mind, she
fatalistically asked herself, before going in, which
thing it would probably be this time. She noticed
with profundity that disappointment made people
selfish; she marvelled at the serenity—it was the
poor woman's only one—of what Marian took for
granted: her own state of abasement as the second-born,
her life reduced to mere inexhaustible
sisterhood. She existed, in that view, wholly for
the small house in Chelsea; the moral of which
moreover, of course, was that the more one gave
oneself the less of one was left. There were always
people to snatch at one, and it would never occur
to <i>them</i> that they were eating one up. They did
that without tasting.

She was learning more about Aunt Maud every day, and she'd already realized that relying on easy comparisons was a mistake. There was a whole side of Aunt Maud, a side of showiness and shallow values, of fancy decorations and overblown emotions. She indulged in superficial things, and her conversations were often misleading. Kate understood that she was a complex and shrewd person. Aunt Maud was as passionate as she was practical. She had a deep-seated set of prejudices. She had a carefully guarded pocket of money that the world recognized her by. She operated with strategic purpose, using both aggressive and defensive tactics. Kate felt she was like someone under siege, with Aunt Maud as the formidable enemy. What made her so dangerous was her lack of scruples and morals.</i></p><p><i>Kate pictured her this way in her own mind. Aunt Maud’s influence created a sense of danger for Kate. The younger woman lingered and hesitated, while the older one, both aggressive and cunning, controlled as much territory as possible.</i></p><p><i>But what, after all, were these dangers, if not the everyday struggles and harsh realities of London life? Mrs. Lowder *was* London, she *was* life—the noise of the siege and the intensity of the fight. There were some things that frightened even the image of Britain. Aunt Maud, however, feared nothing, not even challenging intellectual thought.</i></p><p><i>Kate kept these thoughts to herself. She rarely shared them with poor Marian, whose visits were ostensibly to talk things over. One of Kate's reasons for delaying her final agreement with Aunt Maud was to have more freedom to help her less fortunate relative, Marian, who Aunt Maud wanted nothing to do with. The most difficult part of Kate's situation was that every interaction with her sister weakened her resolve and limited her choices. It further emphasized the role, which was not always uplifting or pleasant, that family played in one's life.</i></p><p><i>She was now confronted with this family bond. The awareness of it seemed to be the most significant thing that had come to her with her mother's death. Much of that awareness had been absorbed and taken away with her mother. Her irritating, demanding father, her intimidating aunt, her nephews and nieces, who had nothing, all intensified Kate's sense of duty and compassion. Kate’s thinking, especially about Marian, was that she could see what could happen to you if you focused too much on family ties. She'd once understood the burden this entailed, back in the days when she, as the second-born, had thought no one in the world was as beautiful as Marian, or as charming, clever, and destined for happiness and success. That view had changed now, but she'd had to maintain a façade of familiarity for various reasons. Marian was no longer beautiful, and Kate didn't see her intelligence as obvious anymore. Nevertheless, bereft, disappointed, demoralized, and irritable, Marian was even more emphatically Kate's elder sister and part of her life. Kate’s most consistent feeling about her was that Marian would force her to do things. Always, in uncomfortable Chelsea, at the door of the small house where Marian lived, and whose small rent weighed on Kate’s mind, she fatalistically asked herself before going inside what Marian would demand this time.</i></p><p><i>She noticed with deep understanding that disappointment made people selfish. She was amazed by the serenity—it was Marian's only comfort—of what Marian took for granted: her own position of subservience as the second-born, her life reduced to nothing more than constant support for her sister. Marian existed, in Kate's view, entirely for the small house in Chelsea, with the moral being that the more one gave, the less of oneself remained. There were always people ready to exploit one’s generosity, and it would never occur to them that they were consuming one’s very being. They did so without any thought.</i></p></div>

There was no such misfortune, or at any rate
no such discomfort, she further reasoned, as to be
formed at once for being and for seeing. You
always saw, in this case, something else than what
you were, and you got, in consequence, none of
the peace of your condition. However, as she
never really let Marian see what she was, Marian
might well not have been aware that she herself
saw. Kate was accordingly, to her own vision,
not a hypocrite of virtue, for she gave herself up;
but she was a hypocrite of stupidity, for she kept
to herself everything that was not herself. What
she most kept was the particular sentiment with
which she watched her sister instinctively neglect
nothing that would make for her submission to
their aunt; a state of the spirit that perhaps marked
most sharply how poor you might become when
you minded so much the absence of wealth. It was
through Kate that Aunt Maud should be worked,
and nothing mattered less than what might become
of Kate in the process. Kate was to burn her
ships, in short, so that Marian should profit; and
Marian's desire to profit was quite oblivious of a
dignity that had, after all, its reasons—if it had
only cared for them—for keeping itself a little stiff.
Kate, to be properly stiff for both of them, would
therefore have had to be selfish, have had to prefer
an ideal of behaviour—than which nothing, ever,
was more selfish—to the possibility of stray crumbs
for the four small creatures. The tale of Mrs.
Lowder's disgust at her elder niece's marriage to
Mr. Condrip had lost little of its point; the incredibly
fatuous behaviour of Mr. Condrip, the parson
of a dull suburban parish, with a saintly profile
which was always in evidence, being so distinctly on
record to keep criticism consistent. He had presented
his profile on system, having, goodness
knew, nothing else to present—nothing at all to
full-face the world with, no imagination of the propriety
of living and minding his business. Criticism
had remained on Aunt Maud's part consistent
enough; she was not a person to regard such proceedings
as less of a mistake for having acquired
more of the privilege of pathos. She had not been
forgiving, and the only approach she made to overlooking
them was by overlooking—with the surviving
delinquent—the solid little phalanx that now
represented them. Of the two sinister ceremonies
that she lumped together, the marriage and the interment,
she had been present at the former, just
as she had sent Marian, before it, a liberal cheque;
but this had not been for her more than the shadow
of an admitted link with Mrs. Condrip's course.
She disapproved of clamorous children for whom
there was no prospect; she disapproved of weeping
widows who couldn't make their errors good;
and she had thus put within Marian's reach one of
the few luxuries left when so much else had gone,
an easy pretext for a constant grievance. Kate
Croy remembered well what their mother, in a different
quarter, had made of it; and it was Marian's
marked failure to pluck the fruit of resentment that
committed them, as sisters, to an almost equal fellowship
in abjection. If the theory was that, yes,
alas, one of the pair had ceased to be noticed, but
that the other was noticed enough to make up for
it, who would fail to see that Kate couldn't separate
herself without a cruel pride? That lesson became
sharp for our young lady the day after her interview
with her father.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She thought there wasn't a problem, or at least nothing that was truly unpleasant, about existing and being aware of yourself simultaneously. You always saw yourself as something different from what you truly were, and as a result, you never found peace in your own situation. However, because she never let Marian truly see her, Marian might not have realized that she herself was also seeing things. So, Kate didn't consider herself a hypocrite in terms of virtue, because she gave herself up completely. Instead, she was a hypocrite in terms of being foolish, because she kept to herself anything that wasn't directly related to her. What she guarded most closely was her private feeling as she watched her sister instinctively do everything possible to please their aunt. This attitude perhaps highlighted how poor you could become if you were overly concerned about not having money. Kate was the one who was meant to manipulate Aunt Maud, and what happened to Kate in the process didn't matter. In short, Kate was supposed to sacrifice everything so Marian could benefit. And Marian's desire to benefit didn't consider the dignity that she, if she had only cared, had reason to maintain. To be properly selfless for both of them, Kate would have had to be selfish, preferring an idea of how she should act – which is, ironically, the most selfish thing of all – over the chance of any advantage for the four children. The story of Mrs. Lowder’s disgust at her older niece's marriage to Mr. Condrip hadn't lost its impact. Mr. Condrip, the pastor of a boring suburban parish, was incredibly foolish, and his saintly profile, which he always displayed, was clearly documented to support consistent criticism. He systematically presented his profile because he had nothing else to offer – no way of confronting the world head-on, no understanding of how to live and mind his own business. Aunt Maud's criticism of the situation remained consistent; she was not the type to think such actions were less of a mistake just because they had acquired more tragic circumstances. She hadn't been forgiving, and the only way she seemed to overlook the issue was to ignore—with the surviving offender—the small, united family they now represented. Of the two terrible events she lumped together, the marriage and the burial, she had attended the former, just as she had sent Marian a generous check before it happened. But this was only a slight acknowledgment of her connection to Mrs. Condrip's choices. She disapproved of noisy children with no future, and she disapproved of weeping widows who couldn't fix their mistakes. Therefore, she had put within Marian's reach one of the few remaining luxuries when so much else was gone: an easy reason to constantly complain. Kate Croy remembered very well how their mother had handled a similar situation in a different context, and it was Marian's noticeable failure to embrace resentment that bound them, as sisters, to almost equal humiliation. If the idea was that, yes, unfortunately, one of them was no longer being noticed, but the other was being noticed enough to compensate, who wouldn't see that Kate couldn't distance herself without being cruelly proud? That lesson became clear to our young woman the day after her meeting with her father.</i></p></div>

It was after the children's dinner, which was also
their mother's, but which their aunt mostly contrived
to keep from ever becoming her own
luncheon; and the two young women were still in
the presence of the crumpled table-cloth, the dispersed
pinafores, the scraped dishes, the lingering
odour of boiled food. Kate had asked, with ceremony,
if she might put up a window a little, and
Mrs. Condrip had replied without it that she might
do as she liked. She often received such inquiries
as if they reflected in a manner on the pure essence
of her little ones. The four had retired, with much
movement and noise, under imperfect control of
the small Irish governess whom their aunt had
hunted out for them and whose brooding resolve
not to prolong so uncrowned a martyrdom she
already more than suspected. Their mother had
become for Kate—who took it just for the effect
of being their mother—quite a different thing from
the mild Marian of the past: Mr. Condrip's widow
expansively obscured that image. She was little
more than a ragged relic, a plain, prosaic result of
him, as if she had somehow been pulled through
him as through an obstinate funnel, only to be left
crumpled and useless and with nothing in her but
what he accounted for. She had grown red and
almost fat, which were not happy signs of mourning;
less and less like any Croy, particularly a Croy
in trouble, and sensibly like her husband's two unmarried
sisters, who came to see her, in Kate's
view, much too often and stayed too long, with the
consequence of inroads upon the tea and bread-and-butter—matters
as to which Kate, not unconcerned
with the tradesmen's books, had feelings.
About them, moreover, Marian <i>was</i> touchy, and
her nearer relative, who observed and weighed
things, noted as an oddity that she would have
taken any reflection on them as a reflection on herself.
If that was what marriage necessarily did to
you, Kate Croy would have questioned marriage.
It was a grave example, at any rate, of what a man—and
such a man!—might make of a woman. She
could see how the Condrip pair pressed their
brother's widow on the subject of Aunt Maud—who
wasn't, after all, <i>their</i> aunt; made her, over
their interminable cups, chatter and even swagger
about Lancaster Gate, made her more vulgar than
it had seemed written that any Croy could possibly
become on such a subject. They laid it down, they
rubbed it in, that Lancaster Gate was to be kept
in sight, and that she, Kate, was to keep it; so
that, curiously, or at all events sadly, our young
woman was sure of being, in her own person, more
permitted to them as an object of comment than
they would in turn ever be permitted to herself.
The beauty of which, too, was that Marian didn't
love them. But they were Condrips—they had
grown near the rose; they were almost like Bertie
and Maudie, like Kitty and Guy. They talked of
the dead to her, which Kate never did; it being a
relation in which Kate could but mutely listen. She
couldn't indeed too often say to herself that if that
was what marriage did to you——! It may easily
be guessed, therefore, that the ironic light of such
reserves fell straight across the field of Marian's
warning. "I don't quite see," she answered,
"where, in particular, it strikes you that my danger
lies. I'm not conscious, I assure you, of the least
'disposition' to throw myself anywhere. I feel
as if, for the present, I have been quite sufficiently
thrown."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was after the children and their mother had eaten dinner. Their aunt usually avoided eating the same meal. The two young women were still surrounded by the messy table, the discarded children's aprons, the dirty dishes, and the lingering smell of cooked food. Kate had formally asked if she could open a window a little, and Mrs. Condrip had replied, without much enthusiasm, that she could do as she liked. She often reacted to such questions as if they questioned the purity of her children. The four children had retreated, making a lot of noise, under the not-very-effective supervision of the young Irish governess their aunt had hired. Kate suspected the governess was already planning to quit her miserable job. For Kate, their mother—who she viewed simply as "the mother"—had become very different from the gentle Marian of the past. Mr. Condrip's widow completely overshadowed that image. She was reduced to a tired, unremarkable version of herself, almost as if she’d been forced through a difficult experience and left crumpled and useless, defined only by her husband. She had become red-faced and almost fat, which wasn't a good sign for someone in mourning. She resembled the husband's two unmarried sisters less and less, especially a Croy in trouble, and instead, took on more of their appearance. Those sisters visited her, in Kate's opinion, far too often and stayed too long, which resulted in them eating a lot of tea and bread-and-butter—something Kate, who was familiar with the household accounts, cared about. Moreover, Marian was sensitive about her sisters-in-law, and Kate, who observed and judged things, found it strange that Marian would take any criticism of her sisters-in-law as a criticism of herself. If marriage did that to you, Kate Croy would have thought twice about getting married. It was a clear example of what a man—especially a man like him!—could do to a woman. She could see how the Condrip sisters pressured their brother's widow about Aunt Maud—who wasn't actually their aunt. They made her, over their endless cups of tea, gossip and even boast about Lancaster Gate, making her more vulgar than any Croy should ever become on the subject. They insisted that Lancaster Gate should remain a goal, and that she, Kate, should keep it in mind. Therefore, strangely, or at least sadly, Kate realized that she was more of a subject of gossip for them than they would ever be for her. The ironic part was that Marian didn't even like them. But they were Condrips—they were connected to wealth and privilege; they were almost like Bertie and Maudie, like Kitty and Guy. They talked about the deceased Mr. Condrip to Marian, which Kate never did. She could only listen silently. She couldn't help but think to herself, if that was what marriage did to you…! It is easy to guess, therefore, that Marian’s warning fell on deaf ears. "I don't understand," she replied, "what specific danger you think I'm in. I assure you, I'm not at all inclined to throw myself into anything. I feel like I've already been through quite enough."</i></p></div>

They faced each other—the tears were in Marian's

She sighed it with as many condonations as her
sister's ear had more than once caught in her "Dear
old Aunt Maud!" These were things that made
Kate, for the time, turn sharply away, and she gathered
herself now to go. They were the note again
of the abject; it was hard to say which of the persons
in question had most shown how little they
liked her. The younger woman proposed, at any
rate, to let discussion rest, and she believed that,
for herself, she had done so during the ten minutes
that, thanks to her wish not to break off short,
elapsed before she could gracefully withdraw. It
then appeared, however, that Marian had been discussing
still, and there was something that, at the
last, Kate had to take up. "Whom do you mean
by Aunt Maud's young man?"

That's how long it had taken her to politely excuse herself because she didn't want to abruptly end the conversation. But then it turned out Marian was still talking, and Kate had to say something.

She had no sooner spoken than she asked herself
what had become of the grace to which she
had sacrificed. Marian certainly did little to save
it, and nothing indeed was so inconsequent as her
ground of complaint. She desired her to "work"
Lancaster Gate as she believed that scene of abundance
could be worked; but she now didn't see
why advantage should be taken of the bloated connection
to put an affront on her own poor home.
She appeared in fact for the moment to take the
position that Kate kept her in her "hole" and
then heartlessly reflected on her being in it. Yet
she didn't explain how she had picked up the report
on which her sister had challenged her—so
that it was thus left to her sister to see in it, once
more, a sign of the creeping curiosity of the Miss
Condrips. They lived in a deeper hole than Marian,
but they kept their ear to the ground, they
spent their days in prowling, whereas Marian, in
garments and shoes that seemed steadily to grow
looser and larger, never prowled. There were times
when Kate wondered if the Miss Condrips were
offered her by fate as a warning for her own future—to
be taken as showing her what she herself
might become at forty if she let things too recklessly
go. What was expected of her by others—and
by so many of them—could, all the same, on
occasion, present itself as beyond a joke; and this
was just now the aspect it particularly wore. She
was not only to quarrel with Merton Densher to
oblige her five spectators—with the Miss Condrips
there were five; she was to set forth in pursuit of
Lord Mark on some preposterous theory of the
premium attached to success. Mrs. Lowder's hand
had attached it, and it figured at the end of the
course as a bell that would ring, break out into
public clamour, as soon as touched. Kate reflected
sharply enough on the weak points of this fond
fiction, with the result at last of a certain chill for
her sister's confidence; though Mrs. Condrip still
took refuge in the plea—which was after all the
great point—that their aunt would be munificent
when their aunt should be pleased. The exact identity
of her candidate was a detail; what was of the
essence was her conception of the kind of match it
was open to her niece to make with her aid. Marian
always spoke of marriages as "matches," but
that was again a detail. Mrs. Lowder's "aid"
meanwhile awaited them—if not to light the way
to Lord Mark, then to somebody better. Marian
would put up, in fine, with somebody better; she
only wouldn't put up with somebody so much
worse. Kate had, once more, to go through all
this before a graceful issue was reached. It was
reached by her paying with the sacrifice of Mr.
Densher for her reduction of Lord Mark to the
absurd. So they separated softly enough. She was
to be let off hearing about Lord Mark so long as
she made it good that she wasn't underhand about
anybody else. She had denied everything and
every one, she reflected as she went away—and that
was a relief; but it also made rather a clean sweep
of the future. The prospect put on a bareness that
already gave her something in common with the
Miss Condrips.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>No sooner had she spoken than she questioned the sense of the sacrifice she had made. Marian certainly wasn't helping the situation, and her complaints were completely illogical. Marian wanted her to "work" Lancaster Gate, believing that area of wealth could be exploited, but now she didn't see why they should use that wealthy connection to insult her own modest home. In fact, she seemed to momentarily believe that Kate was keeping her down and then callously criticized her for it. Yet, she didn't explain how she'd gotten the information that her sister had confronted her with, so it fell to Kate to see it as another sign of the nosy Miss Condrips' creeping curiosity. They lived in a worse situation than Marian, but they kept their ears open and spent their days spying, while Marian, in clothes and shoes that seemed to get bigger and baggier, never bothered. Sometimes, Kate wondered if the Miss Condrips were a warning from fate about her own future—a picture of what she herself might become at forty if she let things get out of control. What was expected of her by others—and by so many of them—could, at times, become unbearable, and that was exactly how it felt now. Not only was she expected to break up with Merton Densher to please her five onlookers—with the Miss Condrips, there were five; she was also supposed to chase after Lord Mark based on some absurd theory about the advantages of success. Mrs. Lowder had created this idea, and it was now like a bell at the end of the race that would ring and cause a public outcry the moment it was touched. Kate considered the flaws in this ridiculous plan, which ultimately made her lose some faith in her sister's confidence. However, Mrs. Condrip took comfort in the fact that their aunt would be generous when she was pleased, which was the most important point. The exact person she chose didn't matter; the key was her idea of the kind of match her niece could make with her help. Marian always called marriages "matches," but that was just another detail. Mrs. Lowder's "help" was waiting for them—if not to lead them to Lord Mark, then to someone better. Marian would be okay with someone better; she just wouldn't accept someone worse. Kate had to go through all of this again before finding a graceful way out. She found it by sacrificing Mr. Densher to make Lord Mark seem ridiculous. So they parted quietly. She wouldn't have to hear about Lord Mark as long as she was honest about everyone else. She had denied everything and everyone, she reflected as she left—and that was a relief; but it also made the future feel very uncertain. The prospect became so bleak that she already felt like she had something in common with the Miss Condrips.</i></p></div>

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Merton Densher, who works nights at a newspaper, often spends time during the day in Kensington Gardens. He walks around without a clear destination, stopping, sitting, and walking again.</p><p>On several of these days, Kate Croy comes out of her aunt's house, crosses the road, and meets him in the Gardens. They then walk together or sit on chairs away from others.</p><p>They first met at a party in a gallery. After being introduced, they talked and looked at each other intently. Six months later, they saw each other on the Underground Railway. They exchanged looks, and Densher stayed on the train past his stop. He moved to sit next to her when a seat became available, and when she got off, he followed her. They walked together.</p><p>After this, Densher asked to visit her, and she agreed. He began visiting her at her aunt's, Mrs. Lowder's, house. Mrs. Lowder invited him to dinner and continued to receive his visits.</p><p>During one of their meetings in the park, Kate tells Densher she is sure her aunt will write to him and that he should be prepared. Densher asks if the aunt thinks he is not good enough for Kate, and Kate clarifies that the aunt thinks he is not good enough for her.</p><p>Kate then tells Densher about her family’s misfortunes, including her father's dishonor, the deaths of her two brothers, and her sister's unhappy marriage. She recounts how she learned of her father's disgrace as a girl without ever knowing the specific details. She tells Densher that she recently offered to go and live with her father to escape her aunt, but he refused her. Both her father and sister insist she must stay with her aunt to be of value to them.</p><p>Densher asks Kate to marry him the next day. She tells him to wait until after he has seen her aunt. He questions her, and she says he is also afraid of her aunt. She states that she will "try for everything" and not sacrifice him. She suggests they should wait and see what they can get from her aunt. Densher asks if his role is to win over the aunt. Kate impatiently tells him to "See her." He asks if he should grovel to her. In response, Kate tells him to do what he likes and walks away.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Merton Densher** is presented as a young journalist whose professional life at night affords him an "appearance of leisure" by day. He is physically described as a "longish, leanish, fairish" Englishman who is difficult to classify by profession or social type; he appears "vague without looking weak—idle without looking empty." He is self-aware of his "strength merely for thought" and his perceived inability to become wealthy. His situation shifts from a routine of aimless-seeming meetings with Kate in Kensington Gardens to an impending confrontation. He is informed by Kate that her aunt will be contacting him, forcing his private relationship into a more formal and challenging context where his "want of means" will be scrutinized.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy** is presented as a sharp, self-aware, and strategic young woman burdened by a disgraced father and a needy family. She is described as "handsome, no doubt, but as hard, and... clever but as cold." She values Densher for his intellect—what she calls "the high, dim things... of the mind"—which her own life has lacked. Her situation is one of calculated risk: she lives under the watch of her powerful aunt while conducting a semi-public romance with Densher. The immediate shift is her decision to precipitate a confrontation between Densher and her aunt, moving their relationship from a private understanding to a direct negotiation with the powerful forces controlling her life.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)** is presented indirectly, through the perceptions of Kate and Densher, as a formidable and wealthy matriarch. She is described as "deep," manipulative, and powerful, a figure who has been "giving them rope." Densher sees her as "magnificently vulgar" and "dangerous," while Kate uses the metaphor of an "eagle with gilded claws." Her situation shifts from that of a passive but knowing observer to an active participant. Her impending decision to formally contact Densher signals the end of her observational period and the beginning of her direct intervention in the couple's affairs.</li></ul>

<p>
Merton Densher, who passed the best
hours of each night at the office of his newspaper,
had at times, during the day, to make up for
it, a sense, or at least an appearance, of leisure, in
accordance with which he was not infrequently to
be met, in different parts of the town, at moments
when men of business are hidden from the public
eye. More than once, during the present winter's
end, he had deviated, toward three o'clock, or toward
four, into Kensington Gardens, where he might
for a while, on each occasion, have been observed
to demean himself as a person with nothing to do.
He made his way indeed, for the most part, with
a certain directness, over to the north side; but
once that ground was reached his behaviour was
noticeably wanting in point. He moved seemingly
at random from alley to alley; he stopped for no
reason and remained idly agaze; he sat down in
a chair and then changed to a bench; after which
he walked about again, only again to repeat both
the vagueness and the vivacity. Distinctly, he was
a man either with nothing at all to do or with ever
so much to think about; and it was not to be denied
that the impression he might often thus easily
make had the effect of causing the burden of proof,
in certain directions, to rest on him. It was a little
the fault of his aspect, his personal marks, which
made it almost impossible to name his profession.

</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Merton Densher, who spent most of his nights working at the newspaper office, sometimes had to compensate during the day. He gave the impression of having free time, and as a result, he was often seen in various parts of the city at times when businessmen were usually out of sight. Several times this winter, around three or four in the afternoon, he had gone to Kensington Gardens, where he could be observed acting like someone with nothing to do. He usually went directly to the north side of the park, but once he got there, his actions became aimless. He wandered from path to path, stopped for no particular reason, and stared blankly. He sat in a chair, then moved to a bench, after which he resumed wandering, repeating the same aimlessness and energy. Clearly, he was either completely idle or deeply lost in thought. There was no denying that the impression he often created this way made people question his purpose. This was partly due to his appearance and his distinctive features, which made it difficult to guess his profession.</i></p></div>

<p>
He was a longish, leanish, fairish young Englishman,
not unamenable, on certain sides, to classification—as
for instance by being a gentleman, by
being rather specifically one of the educated, one
of the generally sound and generally pleasant; yet,
though to that degree neither extraordinary nor
abnormal, he would have failed to play straight into
an observer's hands. He was young for the House
of Commons, he was loose for the army. He was
refined, as might have been said, for the city, and,
quite apart from the cut of his cloth, he was sceptical,
it might have been felt, for the church. On
the other hand he was credulous for diplomacy, or
perhaps even for science, while he was perhaps at
the same time too much in his mere senses for
poetry, and yet too little in them for art. You
would have got fairly near him by making out in
his eyes the potential recognition of ideas; but you
would have quite fallen away again on the question
of the ideas themselves. The difficulty with Densher
was that he looked vague without looking
weak—idle without looking empty. It was the accident,
possibly, of his long legs, which were apt to
stretch themselves; of his straight hair and his well-shaped
head, never, the latter, neatly smooth, and
apt, into the bargain, at the time of quite other
calls upon it, to throw itself suddenly back and,
supported behind by his uplifted arms and interlocked
hands, place him for unconscionable periods
in communion with the ceiling, the tree-tops, the
sky. He was in short visibly absent-minded, irregularly
clever, liable to drop what was near and to
take up what was far; he was more a respecter, in
general, than a follower of custom. He suggested
above all, however, that wondrous state of youth
in which the elements, the metals more or less
precious, are so in fusion and fermentation that
the question of the final stamp, the pressure that
fixes the value, must wait for comparative coolness.
And it was a mark of his interesting mixture that
if he was irritable it was by a law of considerable
subtlety—a law that, in intercourse with him, it
might be of profit, though not easy, to master.
One of the effects of it was that he had for you
surprises of tolerance as well as of temper.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He was a somewhat tall, thin, and rather pale young English man, who was fairly easy to categorize based on certain characteristics. For example, he was a gentleman and clearly educated, with a generally good and agreeable personality. However, despite being relatively ordinary, he wouldn't fit neatly into any preconceived box. He was considered young for a member of Parliament and didn't seem suited for the military. He was too sophisticated, you might say, for a career in finance, and, regardless of his appearance, he was probably too skeptical for the church. Conversely, he seemed trusting enough for a career in diplomacy, or perhaps even in science. He also seemed too focused on physical sensation to appreciate poetry, but not quite focused enough to be truly passionate about art. You could come close to understanding him by noticing in his eyes a potential for understanding ideas, but you would be disappointed by his actual views on those ideas. The problem with Densher was that he appeared to be absent-minded without appearing weak, and lazy without appearing unintelligent. This might have been due to his long legs, which he often stretched out; his straight hair, and his well-shaped head, which never looked perfectly neat. He had a habit of throwing his head back, supported by his raised arms and clasped hands, and gazing at the ceiling, the trees, or the sky for long periods. In short, he was visibly distracted, irregularly intelligent, and tended to forget about what was close at hand while focusing on things that were far away. He generally respected tradition more than he followed it. Above all, he embodied that extraordinary state of youth, where the different aspects of a person, like valuable metals, are in a constant state of flux, and the final shaping, the thing that gives them their true value, has to wait until things settle down. And a sign of his fascinating complexity was that his irritability followed a subtle and complex pattern – a pattern that, in interacting with him, could be rewarding to understand, although not easy to do so. One result of this was that he could surprise you with his tolerance just as easily as he could with his temper.</i></p></div>

He loitered, on the best of the relenting days,
the several occasions we speak of, along the part
of the Gardens nearest to Lancaster Gate, and
when, always, in due time, Kate Croy came out of
her aunt's house, crossed the road and arrived by
the nearest entrance, there was a general publicity
in the proceeding which made it slightly anomalous.
If their meeting was to be bold and free it might
have taken place within doors; if it was to be shy
or secret it might have taken place almost anywhere
better than under Mrs. Lowder's windows.
They failed indeed to remain attached to that spot;
they wandered and strolled, taking in the course
of more than one of these interviews a considerable
walk, or else picked out a couple of chairs under
one of the great trees and sat as much apart—apart
from every one else—as possible. But Kate
had, each time, at first, the air of wishing to expose
herself to pursuit and capture if those things were
in question. She made the point that she was not
underhand, any more than she was vulgar; that the
Gardens were charming in themselves and this use
of them a matter of taste; and that, if her aunt
chose to glare at her from the drawing-room or to
cause her to be tracked and overtaken, she could at
least make it convenient that this should be easily
done. The fact was that the relation between these
young persons abounded in such oddities as were
not inaptly symbolised by assignations that had a
good deal more appearance than motive. Of the
strength of the tie that held them we shall sufficiently
take the measure; but it was meanwhile almost
obvious that if the great possibility had come
up for them it had done so, to an exceptional degree,
under the protection of the famous law of
contraries. Any deep harmony that might eventually
govern them would not be the result of their
having much in common—having anything, in fact,
but their affection; and would really find its explanation
in some sense, on the part of each, of
being poor where the other was rich. It is nothing
new indeed that generous young persons often admire
most what nature hasn't given them—from
which it would appear, after all, that our friends
were both generous.

She felt the Gardens were lovely, and using them was simply a matter of preference. And if her aunt wanted to glare at her from the drawing-room or have her followed and confronted, Kate was at least making it easy to do so.</i></p><p><i>The truth was that their relationship was full of oddities, perfectly represented by these meetings that seemed to be more about appearances than actual reasons for meeting. We'll understand the strength of their connection later, but for now, it was almost obvious that if a great opportunity had arisen for them, it was because of the famous principle of opposites attracting. Any deep compatibility that might eventually unite them wouldn't come from them having much in common—actually, they didn’t have anything in common except their affection. It would be explained by a sense, in each of them, of being lacking something that the other had. It's not unusual for generous young people to admire what they themselves don't possess, which suggests that, after all, our friends were both generous.</i></p></div>

Merton Densher had repeatedly said to himself—and
from far back—that he should be a fool not
to marry a woman whose value would be in her
differences; and Kate Croy, though without having
quite so philosophised, had quickly recognised
in the young man a precious unlikeness. He represented
what her life had never given her and certainly,
without some such aid as his, never would
give her; all the high, dim things she lumped together
as of the mind. It was on the side of the
mind that Densher was rich for her, and mysterious
and strong; and he had rendered her in especial
the sovereign service of making that element real.
She had had, all her days, to take it terribly on
trust; no creature she had ever encountered having
been able in any degree to testify for it directly.
Vague rumours of its existence had made their
precarious way to her; but nothing had, on the
whole, struck her as more likely than that she should
live and die without the chance to verify them.
The chance had come—it was an extraordinary one—on
the day she first met Densher; and it was to
the girl's lasting honour that she knew on the spot
what she was in the presence of. That occasion
indeed, for everything that straightway flowered in
it, would be worthy of high commemoration;
Densher's perception went out to meet the young
woman's and quite kept pace with her own recognition.
Having so often concluded on the fact of
his weakness, as he called it, for life—his strength
merely for thought—life, he logically opined, was
what he must somehow arrange to annex and possess.
This was so much a necessity that thought
by itself only went on in the void; it was from
the immediate air of life that it must draw its breath.
So the young man, ingenious but large, critical but
ardent too, made out both his case and Kate Croy's.
They had originally met before her mother's death—an
occasion marked for her as the last pleasure
permitted by the approach of that event; after
which the dark months had interposed a screen and,
for all Kate knew, made the end one with the beginning.

The beginning—to which she often went back—had
been a scene, for our young woman, of supreme
brilliancy; a party given at a "gallery" hired by a
hostess who fished with big nets. A Spanish
dancer, understood to be at that moment the delight
of the town, an American reciter, the joy of
a kindred people, an Hungarian fiddler, the wonder
of the world at large—in the name of these and
other attractions the company in which, by a rare
privilege, Kate found herself had been freely convoked.
She lived under her mother's roof, as she
considered, obscurely, and was acquainted with few
persons who entertained on that scale; but she had
had dealings with two or three connected, as appeared,
with such—two or three through whom
the stream of hospitality, filtered or diffused, could
thus now and then spread to outlying receptacles.
A good-natured lady in fine, a friend of her mother
and a relative of the lady of the gallery, had offered
to take her to the party in question and had there
fortified her, further, with two or three of those
introductions that, at large parties, lead to other
things—that had at any rate, on this occasion, culminated
for her in conversation with a tall, fair,
slightly unbrushed and rather awkward, but on the
whole not dreary, young man. The young man had
affected her as detached, as—it was indeed what
he called himself—awfully at sea, as much more distinct
from what surrounded them than any one
else appeared to be, and even as probably quite disposed
to be making his escape when pulled up to
be placed in relation with her. He gave her his
word for it indeed, that same evening, that only
their meeting had prevented his flight, but that now
he saw how sorry he should have been to miss it.
This point they had reached by midnight, and
though in respect to such remarks everything was
in the tone, the tone was by midnight there too.
She had had originally her full apprehension of his
coerced, certainly of his vague, condition—full apprehensions
often being with her immediate; then
she had had her equal consciousness that, within
five minutes, something between them had—well,
she couldn't call it anything but <i>come.</i> It was nothing,
but it was somehow everything—it was that
something for each of them had happened.

It was a party at a rented art gallery, thrown by a hostess known for her lavish events. There was a Spanish dancer, considered the city’s favorite at the time, an American comedian, a hit with his countrymen, and a Hungarian violinist, who was celebrated worldwide. These, along with other performers, were the main attractions, and the party was easily filled with guests, including Kate, who was fortunate enough to have received an invitation.</i></p><p><i>She lived at home with her mother, feeling rather unnoticed by society.

They had found themselves looking at each other
straight, and for a longer time on end than was
usual even at parties in galleries; but that, after all,
would have been a small affair, if there hadn't been
something else with it. It wasn't, in a word, simply
that their eyes had met; other conscious organs,
faculties, feelers had met as well, and when Kate
afterwards imaged to herself the sharp, deep fact
she saw it, in the oddest way, as a particular performance.
She had observed a ladder against a
garden wall, and had trusted herself so to climb
it as to be able to see over into the probable garden
on the other side. On reaching the top she had
found herself face to face with a gentleman engaged
in a like calculation at the same moment, and the
two inquirers had remained confronted on their
ladders. The great point was that for the rest of
that evening they had been perched—they had not
climbed down; and indeed, during the time that
followed, Kate at least had had the perched feeling—it
was as if she were there aloft without a retreat.
A simpler expression of all this is doubtless but
that they had taken each other in with interest; and
without a happy hazard six months later the incident
would have closed in that account of it. The
accident, meanwhile, had been as natural as anything
in London ever is: Kate had one afternoon
found herself opposite Mr. Densher on the Underground
Railway. She had entered the train at
Sloane Square to go to Queen's Road, and the carriage
in which she had found a place was all but
full. Densher was already in it—on the other
bench and at the furthest angle; she was sure of
him before they had again started. The day and
the hour were darkness, there were six other persons,
and she had been busy placing herself; but
her consciousness had gone to him as straight as
if they had come together in some bright level of
the desert. They had on neither part a second's
hesitation; they looked across the choked compartment
exactly as if she had known he would
be there and he had expected her to come in; so
that, though in the conditions they could only exchange
the greeting of movements, smiles, silence,
it would have been quite in the key of these passages
that they should have alighted for ease at the
very next station. Kate was in fact sure that the
very next station was the young man's true goal—which
made it clear that he was going on only
from the wish to speak to her. He had to go on,
for this purpose, to High Street, Kensington, as
it was not till then that the exit of a passenger gave
him his chance.

The coincidence, however, was about as common as anything in London: One afternoon, Kate found herself sitting across from Mr. Densher on the subway. She got on at Sloane Square, heading towards Queen's Road, and the car she chose was almost full. Densher was already there, sitting across the aisle at the far end.

His chance put him, however, in quick possession
of the seat facing her, the alertness of his capture
of which seemed to show her his impatience.
It helped them, moreover, with strangers on either
side, little to talk; though this very restriction perhaps
made such a mark for them as nothing else
could have done. If the fact that their opportunity
had again come round for them could be so intensely
expressed between them without a word,
they might very well feel on the spot that it had
not come round for nothing. The extraordinary
part of the matter was that they were not in the
least meeting where they had left off, but ever so
much further on, and that these added links added
still another between High Street and Notting Hill
Gate, and then between the latter station and
Queen's Road an extension really inordinate. At
Notting Hill Gate, Kate's right-hand neighbour
descended, whereupon Densher popped straight
into that seat; only there was not much gained
when a lady, the next instant, popped into Densher's.
He could say almost nothing to her—she
scarce knew, at least, what he said; she was so occupied
with a certainty that one of the persons
opposite, a youngish man with a single eyeglass,
which he kept constantly in position, had made her
out from the first as visibly, as strangely affected.
If such a person made her out, what then did
Densher do?—a question in truth sufficiently answered
when, on their reaching her station, he instantly
followed her out of the train. That had
been the real beginning—the beginning of everything
else; the other time, the time at the party,
had been but the beginning of <i>that.</i> Never in life
before had she so let herself go; for always before—so
far as small adventures could have been in
question for her—there had been, by the vulgar
measure, more to go upon. He had walked
with her to Lancaster Gate, and then she had
walked with him away from it—for all the world,
she said to herself, like the housemaid giggling to
the baker.

This appearance, she was afterwards to feel, had
been all in order for a relation that might precisely
best be described in the terms of the baker and the
housemaid. She could say to herself that from that
hour they had kept company; that had come to
represent, technically speaking, alike the range and
the limit of their tie. He had on the spot, naturally,
asked leave to call upon her—which, as a young
person who wasn't really young, who didn't pretend
to be a sheltered flower, she as rationally gave.
That—she was promptly clear about it—was now
her only possible basis; she was just the contemporary
London female, highly modern, inevitably
battered, honourably free. She had of course taken
her aunt straight into her confidence—had gone
through the form of asking her leave; and she subsequently
remembered that though, on this occasion,
she had left the history of her new alliance as
scant as the facts themselves, Mrs. Lowder had
struck her at the time surprisingly mild. It had
been, in every way, the occasion, full of the reminder
that her hostess was deep: it was definitely
then that she had begun to ask herself what Aunt
Maud was, in vulgar parlance, "up to." "You
may receive, my dear, whom you like"—that was
what Aunt Maud, who in general objected to people's
doing as they liked, had replied; and it bore,
this unexpectedness, a good deal of looking into.
There were many explanations, and they were all
amusing—amusing, that is, in the line of the sombre
and brooding amusement, cultivated by Kate in
her actual high retreat. Merton Densher came the
very next Sunday; but Mrs. Lowder was so consistently
magnanimous as to make it possible to
her niece to see him alone. She saw him, however,
on the Sunday following, in order to invite him to
dinner; and when, after dining, he came again—which
he did three times, she found means to treat
his visit as preponderantly to herself. Kate's conviction
that she didn't like him made that remarkable;
it added to the evidence, by this time voluminous,
that she was remarkable all round. If she
had been, in the way of energy, merely usual, she
would have kept her dislike direct; whereas it was
now as if she were seeking to know him in order to
see best where to "have" him. That was one of
the reflections made in our young woman's high
retreat; she smiled from her lookout, in the silence
that was only the fact of hearing irrelevant sounds,
as she caught the truth that you could easily accept
people when you wanted them so to be delivered
to you. When Aunt Maud wished them despatched,
it was not to be done by deputy; it was
clearly always a matter reserved for her own hand.
But what made the girl wonder most was the
implications of so much diplomacy in respect to her
own value. What view might she take of her position
in the light of this appearance that her companion
feared so, as yet, to upset her? It was as
if Densher were accepted partly under the dread
that if he hadn't been she would act in resentment.
Hadn't her aunt considered the danger that she
would in that case have broken off, have seceded?
The danger was exaggerated—she would have done
nothing so gross; but that, it seemed, was the way
Mrs. Lowder saw her and believed her to be reckoned
with. What importance therefore did she
really attach to her, what strange interest could
she take on their keeping on terms? Her father and
her sister had their answer to this—even without
knowing how the question struck her; they saw
the lady of Lancaster Gate as panting to make her
fortune, and the explanation of that appetite was
that, on the accident of a nearer view than she had
before enjoyed, she had been charmed, been dazzled.
They approved, they admired in her one of the
belated fancies of rich, capricious, violent old women—the
more marked, moreover, because the result
of no plot; and they piled up the possible results
for the person concerned. Kate knew what to think
of her own power thus to carry by storm; she saw
herself as handsome, no doubt, but as hard, and
felt herself as clever but as cold; and as so much
too imperfectly ambitious, furthermore, that it was
a pity, for a quiet life, she couldn't settle to be
either finely or stupidly indifferent. Her intelligence
sometimes kept her still—too still—but her
want of it was restless; so that she got the good,
it seemed to her, of neither extreme. She saw herself
at present, none the less, in a situation, and
even her sad, disillusioned mother, dying, but with
Aunt Maud interviewing the nurse on the stairs,
had not failed to remind her that it was of the
essence of situations to be, under Providence,
worked. The dear woman had died in the belief
that she was actually working the one then produced.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She realized later that this initial meeting was the start of a relationship best described as a straightforward, almost transactional, arrangement. She could tell herself that from that moment on, they were seeing each other, which, technically speaking, defined both the scope and the limitations of their connection. He immediately asked if he could call on her, which she, being a woman who wasn't really young and wasn't pretending to be naive, rationally allowed. That, she was instantly clear about, was now her only possible foundation; she was just a modern, independent London woman, inevitably experienced, and honorably free. She had, of course, immediately confided in her aunt and asked for her permission; and she later remembered that, although on this occasion she kept the details of her new relationship brief, Mrs. Lowder had been surprisingly agreeable. It was an instance that emphasized how insightful her hostess was; it was then that she began to wonder what Aunt Maud was, in common terms, "up to." "You may see anyone you like, my dear" – that's what Aunt Maud, who usually didn't allow people to do as they pleased, had replied; and this unexpected response was worth further investigation. There were many explanations, all amusing—amusing, that is, in the way of a thoughtful, almost cynical amusement, that Kate cultivated in her private reflection. Merton Densher came the very next Sunday; but Mrs. Lowder was consistently gracious, which allowed her niece to see him alone. However, she saw him the following Sunday to invite him to dinner; and when, after dining, he came again – which he did three times – she made sure his visits were mainly for her. Kate's conviction that she didn't like him was noteworthy; it added to the growing evidence that she was a remarkable person in general. If she had been, in terms of her personality, ordinary, she would have directly expressed her dislike; instead, it was as if she were trying to get to know him to figure out how to "use" him. That was one of the thoughts that arose during our young woman's reflection; she smiled from her vantage point, in the silence, which was only the sound of irrelevant noises, as she realized that you could easily accept people when you wanted them to be in your control. When Aunt Maud wanted them gone, it was never to be done by someone else; it was always clearly something she took care of herself. But what made the girl wonder most was the significance of all this planning concerning her own worth. What should she think about her position, considering this behavior that her companion seemed so afraid to disrupt? It was as if Densher was being accepted partly out of fear that if he wasn't, she would react with resentment. Hadn't her aunt considered the risk that she would have broken off the relationship, have left? The danger was exaggerated—she wouldn't have done anything so extreme; but that, it seemed, was how Mrs. Lowder saw her and believed she had to be taken seriously. How important was she, then, to Mrs. Lowder? What strange interest could she possibly have in their maintaining the relationship? Her father and sister had their answer to this—even without knowing how she felt about it; they saw the woman of Lancaster Gate as eager to secure her own wealth, and the explanation for that desire was that, having gotten closer to her than before, she was charmed, dazzled. They approved, they admired in her one of the late-life fascinations of rich, unpredictable, powerful old women – all the more remarkable because it wasn't the result of any plan; and they listed the possible benefits for the person involved. Kate knew what to think of her own ability to win over people so quickly; she saw herself as attractive, no doubt, but also as tough, and felt herself as clever but cold; and as not ambitious enough, moreover, so that it was a shame, for the sake of a quiet life, she couldn't bring herself to be either subtly or foolishly indifferent. Her intelligence sometimes kept her still—too still—but her lack of it was restless; so that she felt she didn't get the advantage of either extreme. She saw herself now, nonetheless, in a situation, and even her sad, disillusioned mother, dying, but with Aunt Maud questioning the nurse on the stairs, had not failed to remind her that situations had to be worked, with God's help.

Kate took one of her walks with Densher just
after her visit to Mr. Croy; but most of it went, as
usual, to their sitting in talk. They had, under the
trees, by the lake, the air of old friends—phases of
apparent earnestness, in particular, in which they
might have been settling every question in their vast
young world; and periods of silence, side by side,
perhaps even more, when "a long engagement!"
would have been the final reading of the signs on
the part of a passer struck with them, as it was so
easy to be. They would have presented themselves
thus as very old friends rather than as young persons
who had met for the first time but a year before
and had spent most of the interval without
contact. It was indeed for each, already, as if they
were older friends; and though the succession of
their meetings might, between them, have been
straightened out, they only had a confused sense
of a good many, very much alike, and a confused
intention of a good many more, as little different
as possible. The desire to keep them just as they
were had perhaps to do with the fact that in spite
of the presumed diagnosis of the stranger there had
been for them as yet no formal, no final understanding.
Densher had at the very first pressed the question,
but that, it had been easy to reply, was too
soon; so that a singular thing had afterwards happened.
They had accepted their acquaintance as
too short for an engagement, but they had treated
it as long enough for almost anything else, and
marriage was somehow before them like a temple
without an avenue. They belonged to the temple
and they met in the grounds; they were in the
stage at which grounds in general offered much
scattered refreshment. But Kate had meanwhile
had so few confidants that she wondered at the
source of her father's suspicions. The diffusion of
rumour was of course, in London, remarkable, and
for Marian not less—as Aunt Maud touched neither
directly—the mystery had worked. No doubt she
had been seen. Of course she had been seen. She
had taken no trouble not to be seen, and it was
a thing, clearly, she was incapable of taking. But
she had been seen how?—and <i>what</i> was there to see?
She was in love—she knew that: but it was wholly
her own business, and she had the sense of having
conducted herself, of still so doing, with almost
violent conformity.

They sat under the trees by the lake, acting like old friends. There were moments of serious discussion, where they might have appeared to be resolving all the big issues in their young lives. Then there were long periods of silence together, which might have led an observer to conclude, "They've been engaged forever!"—it was that easy to assume. They seemed more like very old friends than young people who had only met a year ago and spent most of that time apart. In fact, it already felt that way to each of them. Although they could have easily traced the chronology of their meetings, they mostly had a jumbled memory of a lot of them, all very similar, and a vague plan to have many more, just as unremarkable. Their wish to keep things the same might have been related to the fact that, despite what an outsider might assume, they still hadn't had a formal, final agreement. Densher had brought up the question right away, but Kate had easily replied that it was too soon. After that, a strange thing had happened. They considered their relationship too new for engagement, but they treated it as if it were long enough for almost anything else. Marriage was somehow just out of reach, like a temple without a path to it. They belonged to the temple and they met on the grounds. They were at a stage where the grounds offered many enjoyable, scattered experiences. But Kate had so few confidantes that she was puzzled about how her father had become suspicious.

"Well," said Kate after an instant, "her idea of
that is what you'll have from her." He gave her
a long look, and whatever else people who wouldn't
let her alone might have wished, for her advancement,
his long looks were the thing in the world
she could never have enough of. What she felt was
that, whatever might happen, she must keep them,
must make them most completely her possession;
and it was already strange enough that she reasoned,
or at all events began to act, as if she might work
them in with other and alien things, privately cherish
them, and yet, as regards the rigour of it, pay
no price. She looked it well in the face, she took
it intensely home, that they were lovers; she rejoiced
to herself and, frankly, to him, in their wearing
of the name; but, distinguished creature that,
in her way, she was, she took a view of this character
that scarce squared with the conventional. The
character itself she insisted on as their right, taking
that so for granted that it didn't seem even bold;
but Densher, though he agreed with her, found
himself moved to wonder at her simplifications, her
values. Life might prove difficult—was evidently
going to; but meanwhile they had each other, and
that was everything. This was her reasoning, but
meanwhile, for <i>him,</i> each other was what they didn't
have, and it was just the point. Repeatedly, however,
it was a point that, in the face of strange and
special things, he judged it rather awkwardly gross
to urge. It was impossible to keep Mrs. Lowder
out of their scheme. She stood there too close to
it and too solidly; it had to open a gate, at a given
point, do what they would to take her in. And she
came in, always, while they sat together rather helplessly
watching her, as in a coach-in-four; she drove
round their prospect as the principal lady at the
circus drives round the ring, and she stopped the
coach in the middle to alight with majesty. It was
our young man's sense that she was magnificently
vulgar, but yet, quite, that this wasn't all. It wasn't
with her vulgarity that she felt his want of means,
though that might have helped her richly to embroider
it; nor was it with the same infirmity that
she was strong, original, dangerous.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Well," Kate said after a moment, "her idea of all this is what you'll get from her." He looked at her intently, and whatever else people who wanted her to succeed might have wished for, her ability to make him look at her like that was the most important thing in the world to her. What she felt was that, no matter what happened, she had to keep those looks, had to make them completely hers; and it was already strange enough that she was thinking, or at least beginning to act, as if she could incorporate them with other things, secretly treasure them, and yet, in terms of consequences, not have to pay anything. She fully understood that they were lovers; she reveled in that fact, both to herself and frankly to him, and they openly used the term. But, being the unique person she was, she approached this relationship in a way that was unconventional. She insisted on having this relationship as their right, taking it for granted in a way that didn't even seem daring; but Densher, though he agreed with her, found himself surprised by her simplifications, her values. Life might become difficult—it obviously would—but in the meantime they had each other, and that was all that mattered. This was her reasoning, but for him, in the meantime, they didn't really *have* each other, and that was the problem. However, he kept finding that, in the face of their strange situation, it seemed rather insensitive to bring up this point. It was impossible to exclude Mrs. Lowder from their plans. She was too involved and powerful; their plans had to involve her in some way, no matter what. And she *did* get involved, always, while they sat together rather helplessly watching her, as if she were in a horse-drawn carriage; she paraded around their situation like the main figure in a circus, and then stopped the carriage in the middle of it to get out with regal authority. Our young man felt that she was magnificently vulgar, but also that there was more to her than that. It wasn't because of her vulgarity that she was aware of his lack of money, although that might have made her more likely to criticize it; nor was her strength, originality, and danger based on that.</i></p></div>

His want of means—of means sufficient for anyone
but himself—was really the great ugliness, and
was, moreover, at no time more ugly for him than
when it rose there, as it did seem to rise, shameless,
face to face with the elements in Kate's life
colloquially and conveniently classed by both of
them as funny. He sometimes indeed, for that matter,
asked himself if these elements were as funny
as the innermost fact, so often vivid to him, of his
own consciousness—his private inability to believe
he should ever be rich. His conviction on this head
was in truth quite positive and a thing by itself; he
failed, after analysis, to understand it, though he
had naturally more lights on it than any one else.
He knew how it subsisted in spite of an equal consciousness
of his being neither mentally nor physically
quite helpless, neither a dunce nor a cripple;
he knew it to be absolute, though secret, and also,
strange to say, about common undertakings, not
discouraging, not prohibitive. Only now was he
having to think if it were prohibitive in respect to
marriage; only now, for the first time, had he to
weigh his case in scales. The scales, as he sat with
Kate, often dangled in the line of his vision; he
saw them, large and black, while he talked or listened,
take, in the bright air, singular positions.
Sometimes the right was down and sometimes the
left; never a happy equipoise—one or the other
always kicking the beam. Thus was kept before
him the question of whether it were more ignoble
to ask a woman to take her chance with you, or to
accept it from one's conscience that her chance
could be at the best but one of the degrees of privation;
whether, too, otherwise, marrying for money
mightn't after all be a smaller cause of shame than
the mere dread of marrying without. Through
these variations of mood and view, all the same, the
mark on his forehead stood clear; he saw himself
remain without whether he married or not. It was
a line on which his fancy could be admirably active;
the innumerable ways of making money were beautifully
present to him; he could have handled them,
for his newspaper, as easily as he handled everything.
He was quite aware how he handled everything;
it was another mark on his forehead; the
pair of smudges from the thumb of fortune, the
brand on the passive fleece, dated from the primal
hour and kept each other company. He wrote, as
for print, with deplorable ease; since there had been
nothing to stop him even at the age of ten, so
there was as little at twenty; it was part of his fate
in the first place and part of the wretched public's
in the second. The innumerable ways of making
money were, no doubt, at all events, what his imagination
often was busy with after he had tilted
his chair and thrown back his head with his hands
clasped behind it. What would most have prolonged
that attitude, moreover, was the reflection
that the ways were ways only for others. Within
the minute, now—however this might be—he was
aware of a nearer view than he had yet quite had
of those circumstances on his companion's part that
made least for simplicity of relation. He saw above
all how she saw them herself, for she spoke of them
at present with the last frankness, telling him of her
visit to her father and giving him, in an account of
her subsequent scene with her sister, an instance of
how she was perpetually reduced to patching up, in
one way or another, that unfortunate woman's
hopes.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>His lack of money—not just enough for him, but enough for anyone—was truly the biggest problem, and it seemed especially ugly to him when it surfaced, shamelessly confronting the "funny" aspects of Kate's life (a description they both used). Sometimes he wondered if those "funny" aspects were actually as funny as the most basic fact he was aware of – his own conviction that he would never be rich. This belief was unwavering and unique to him; he couldn't fully understand it, even though he knew more about it than anyone else. He knew it persisted despite his understanding that he wasn't helpless, either mentally or physically—not stupid, not disabled. He knew this belief was absolute, though hidden, and surprisingly didn't discourage him from common goals. Only now was he forced to consider if it would prevent him from marrying; only now did he have to weigh his situation. The scales, as he sat with Kate, were often in his mind; he pictured them, large and dark, shifting positions as he talked or listened. Sometimes the right side was down, sometimes the left, never a balance—always tipped one way or the other. This forced him to consider whether it was more shameful to ask a woman to risk her future with him, or to acknowledge that, in his conscience, her life with him would involve some level of poverty; whether, also, marrying for money might be less shameful than being too afraid to marry without it. Through these shifting thoughts, the truth remained clear: he knew he would remain poor whether he married or not. He could vividly imagine the many ways to make money, and they were always present in his thoughts; he could write about them for his newspaper as easily as he wrote about anything else. He was very aware of how easily he wrote; it was another mark on him, a sign of his destiny, a constant reminder. He wrote easily, deplorably so; nothing had stopped him, even at age ten, and nothing now at twenty—it was both his fate and the public's. The many ways to make money were what his imagination often focused on when he leaned back in his chair with his hands clasped behind his head. What would prolong that attitude most was realizing that those opportunities were only available to other people. In the moment, however, he was more aware than ever of the complexities in Kate's life that complicated their relationship. He understood how she saw them, because she spoke about them frankly, telling him about her visit to her father and describing a recent argument with her sister, illustrating how she constantly had to repair that unfortunate woman's hopes.</i></p></div>

"The tune," she exclaimed, "to which we're a
failure as a family!" With which he had it again
all from her—and this time, as it seemed to him,
more than all: the dishonour her father had brought
them, his folly and cruelty and wickedness; the
wounded state of her mother, abandoned, despoiled
and helpless, yet, for the management of such a
home as remained to them, dreadfully unreasonable
too; the extinction of her two young brothers—one,
at nineteen, the eldest of the house, by typhoid
fever, contracted at a poisonous little place, as they
had afterwards found out, that they had taken for
a summer; the other, the flower of the flock, a
middy on the <i>Britannia,</i> dreadfully drowned, and
not even by an accident at sea, but by cramp, unrescued,
while bathing, too late in the autumn, in
a wretched little river during a holiday visit to the
home of a shipmate. Then Marian's unnatural marriage,
in itself a kind of spiritless turning of the
other cheek to fortune: her actual wretchedness
and plaintiveness, her greasy children, her impossible
claims, her odious visitors—these things completed
the proof of the heaviness, for them all, of the
hand of fate. Kate confessedly described them with
an excess of impatience; it was much of her charm
for Densher that she gave in general that turn to
her descriptions, partly as if to amuse him by free
and humorous colour, partly—and that charm was
the greatest—as if to work off, for her own relief,
her constant perception of the incongruity of things.
She had seen the general show too early and too
sharply, and she was so intelligent that she knew it
and allowed for that misfortune; therefore when,
in talk with him, she was violent and almost unfeminine,
it was almost as if they had settled, for
intercourse, on the short cut of the fantastic and
the happy language of exaggeration. It had come
to be definite between them at a primary stage that,
if they could have no other straight way, the realm
of thought at least was open to them. They could
think whatever they liked about whatever they
would—or, in other words, they could say it. Saying
it for each other, for each other alone, only
of course added to the taste. The implication was
thereby constant that what they said when not together
had no taste for them at all, and nothing
could have served more to launch them, at special
hours, on their small floating island than such an
assumption that they were only making believe
everywhere else. Our young man, it must be added,
was conscious enough that it was Kate who profited
most by this particular play of the fact of intimacy.
It always seemed to him that she had more life
than he to react from, and when she recounted the
dark disasters of her house and glanced at the hard,
odd offset of her present exaltation—since as exaltation
it was apparently to be considered—he felt
his own grey domestic annals to make little show.
It was naturally, in all such reference, the question
of her father's character that engaged him most,
but her picture of her adventure in Chirk Street
gave him a sense of how little as yet that character
was clear to him. What was it, to speak plainly, that
Mr. Croy had originally done?

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"That tune," she declared, "is what makes our family such a mess!" And with that, she unloaded everything on him again—and this time, it seemed to him, even more than before: the shame her father had brought on them, his foolishness, his cruelty, his evil behavior. There was also her mother's broken spirit, abandoned, taken advantage of, and helpless, and yet, also maddeningly difficult to deal with in running what was left of their home. Then there was the loss of her two young brothers—one, the eldest at nineteen, who died of typhoid fever, which he'd caught at a terrible little place they'd rented for the summer; they only found out later how dangerous it was. The other brother, the best of the family, a midshipman on the Britannia, drowned in a horrible way. It wasn't even an accident at sea, but from a cramp while he was swimming, and no one could save him. It happened during a holiday visit to a shipmate's home, late in the autumn, in a wretched little river. And then there was Marian's unnatural marriage, a kind of passive acceptance of bad luck. Her actual misery and complaining, her messy children, her unreasonable demands, her awful visitors—all of this proved just how heavy fate had been on them. Kate readily admitted she could be impatient when describing things, and that was part of her appeal to Densher. She usually added that tone to her stories, partly to entertain him with colorful and humorous language, but mostly—and this was her greatest charm—to release herself from her constant awareness of how absurd things were. She'd seen the bigger picture of life too early and too clearly, and she was intelligent enough to know it and to accept that this was unfortunate. Therefore, when she was angry and almost unladylike in their conversations, it was as if they had agreed to communicate through the shortcut of fantasy and the happy language of exaggeration. They'd established early on that if they couldn't find a direct path in life, at least they had the freedom of thought. They could think whatever they wanted about whatever they wanted—or, in other words, they could say it. Saying it to each other, and to each other alone, of course, made it all the better. The unspoken understanding was that what they said when they weren't together had no meaning for them, and this assumption—that they were just pretending everywhere else—was the perfect way to get them started on their little private island at certain times. Our young man, it should be added, was aware that Kate benefited the most from their intimate conversations. It always seemed to him that she had more to react against, more to cope with in her life. When she recounted the family's dark tragedies and hinted at her current elation—because that's what it seemed to be—he felt his own rather boring life stories didn't compare. Naturally, in all these discussions, he was most interested in her father's character, but her description of her experience in Chirk Street made him realize how little he understood her father. What, to put it simply, had Mr. Croy done in the first place?</i></p></div>

"I don't know—and I don't want to. I only
know that years and years ago—when I was about
fifteen—something or other happened that made
him impossible. I mean impossible for the world at
large first, and then, little by little, for mother. We
of course didn't know it at the time," Kate explained,
"but we knew it later; and it was, oddly
enough, my sister who first made out that he had
done something. I can hear her now—the way,
one cold, black Sunday morning when, on account
of an extraordinary fog, we had not gone to church,
she broke it to me by the school-room fire. I was
reading a history-book by the lamp—when we
didn't go to church we had to read history-books—and
I suddenly heard her say, out of the fog, which
was in the room, and <i>apropos</i> of nothing: 'Papa
has done something wicked.' And the curious thing
was that I believed it on the spot and have believed
it ever since, though she could tell me nothing
more—neither what was the wickedness, nor how
she knew, nor what would happen to him, nor anything
else about it. We had our sense, always, that
all sorts of things <i>had</i> happened, were all the while
happening, to him; so that when Marian only said
she was sure, tremendously sure, that she had made
it out for herself, but that that was enough, I took
her word for it—it seemed somehow so natural.
We were not, however, to ask mother—which made
it more natural still, and I said never a word. But
mother, strangely enough, spoke of it to me, in
time, of her own accord very much later on. He
hadn't been with us for ever so long, but we were
used to that. She must have had some fear, some
conviction that I had an idea, some idea of her own
that it was the best thing to do. She came out as
abruptly as Marian had done: 'If you hear anything
against your father—anything I mean, except that
he's odious and vile—remember it's perfectly false.'
That was the way I knew—it was true, though I
recall that I said to her then that I of course knew
it wasn't. She might have told me it was true, and
yet have trusted me to contradict fiercely enough
any accusation of him that I should meet—to contradict
it much more fiercely and effectively, I think,
than she would have done herself. As it happens,
however," the girl went on, "I've never had occasion,
and I've been conscious of it with a sort of surprise.
It has made the world, at times, seem more
decent. No one has so much as breathed to me.
That has been a part of the silence, the silence that
surrounds him, the silence that, for the world, has
washed him out. He doesn't exist for people.
And yet I'm as sure as ever. In fact, though I know
no more than I did then, I'm more sure. And that,"
she wound up, "is what I sit here and tell you about
my own father. If you don't call it a proof of confidence
I don't know what will satisfy you."

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>A man receives a telegram from Mrs. Lowder and goes to her house at Lancaster Gate, where he waits in her drawing-room for a long time. When Mrs. Lowder appears, she tells him that she intends for her niece, Kate, to marry a "great man." She says that while he is incompatible with this plan, she will not banish him but will allow him to continue to see Kate.</p><p>The man, Densher, later tells Kate about the meeting. He also informs her that his newspaper has offered him a multi-week assignment in America, which he must start immediately. Kate urges him to go. He then tells her about his foreign upbringing, which Mrs. Lowder had criticized.</p><p>While in a park, Kate spontaneously tells Densher, "I engage myself to you for ever," and he pledges himself to her in return. They move to a more private spot where they exchange vows and seal their compact, becoming an affianced couple. They agree to keep their engagement a secret for the time being. They discuss how they will correspond while he is away and what Kate will say if her aunt questions their relationship. Kate says she will admit that she loves him. Densher embraces her before he departs.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Merton Densher**</li>
He is presented as a highly analytical and self-aware man, conscious of his social and financial inferiority. He enters the situation prepared to be "patient, ridiculous, [and] diplomatic" for the woman he loves. Initially, he is intimidated by Mrs. Lowder's wealth and power, which he views with aesthetic revulsion, feeling it as a "portentous negation of his own world." His situation shifts dramatically when the dreaded confrontation with Mrs. Lowder turns into a surprisingly civil, strategic negotiation. This is immediately followed by an unexpected professional opportunity—a journalistic assignment in America—and a secret engagement to Kate. He moves from a position of anxious waiting to one of active commitment and impending departure.
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
She is presented as a formidable, powerful, and strategic figure, whose character is first established by her "massive, florid" and "colossally vulgar" home. Densher perceives her as a "lioness" and a force comparable to the "car of Juggernaut." In person, however, she is surprisingly "bland" and "adroit," choosing not to use open aggression. She sees her niece as a valuable "investment" and operates with a clear, long-term plan. Her situation remains unchanged; she is the established power, confidently manipulating events by granting limited approval to Densher, whom she shrewdly assesses and seems to personally, if conditionally, like.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li></ul>
Presented through Densher's eyes as a figure of "pride," she reveals herself in dialogue to be intelligent, pragmatic, and decisive. She fully understands her aunt's strategy and immediately grasps the importance of Densher's job offer, urging him to accept. Her situation shifts from being the subject of a power struggle to an active agent in her own future. She initiates a secret but profound engagement with Densher ("I engage myself to you for ever"), solidifying their bond and establishing a clear, clandestine plan before his departure.

<p>
His eyes had followed her at this time quite long
enough, before he overtook her, to make out more
than ever, in the poise of her head, the pride of her
step—he didn't know what best to call it—a part,
at least, of Mrs. Lowder's reasons. He consciously
winced while he figured his presenting himself as
a reason opposed to these; though, at the same
moment, with the source of Aunt Maud's inspiration
thus before him, he was prepared to conform,
by almost any abject attitude or profitable compromise,
to his companion's easy injunction. He
would do as <i>she</i> liked—his own liking might come
off as it would. He would help her to the utmost
of his power; for, all the rest of that day and the
next, her easy injunction, tossed off that way as
she turned her beautiful back, was like the crack
of a great whip in the blue air, the high element in
which Mrs. Lowder hung. He wouldn't grovel
perhaps—he wasn't quite ready for that; but he
would be patient, ridiculous, reasonable, unreasonable,
and above all deeply diplomatic. He would
be clever, with all his cleverness—which he now
shook hard, as he sometimes shook his poor, dear,
shabby, old watch, to start it up again. It wasn't,
thank goodness, as if there weren't plenty of that,
and with what they could muster between them it
would be little to the credit of their star, however
pale, that defeat and surrender—surrender so early,
so immediate—should have to ensue. It was not
indeed that he thought of that disaster as, at the
worst, a direct sacrifice of their possibilities: he imaged—it
which was enough as some proved vanity,
some exposed fatuity, in the idea of bringing
Mrs. Lowder round. When, shortly afterwards, in
this lady's vast drawing-room—the apartments at
Lancaster Gate had struck him from the first as of
prodigious extent—he awaited her, at her request,
conveyed in a "reply-paid" telegram, his theory
was that of their still clinging to their idea, though
with a sense of the difficulty of it really enlarged to
the scale of the place.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He had been watching her for a while before he caught up to her. He noticed, in the way she held her head and the confidence in her stride – he didn't know what to call it exactly – something that explained, at least in part, Mrs. Lowder's motives. He felt a pang of discomfort as he imagined presenting himself as someone who would go against those motives. But at the same time, with the source of Aunt Maud's influence right there, he was ready to do whatever it took, no matter how humiliating or compromising, to please his companion. He would do whatever she wanted; his own desires didn’t matter. He would help her as much as he could because, for the rest of that day and the next, her casual instruction, delivered as she turned away with her beautiful back, felt like a whip cracking in the air, the rarefied atmosphere in which Mrs. Lowder reigned. He wouldn’t grovel, perhaps – he wasn’t quite prepared for that – but he would be patient, even ridiculous, reasonable, unreasonable, and, above all, very diplomatic. He would use all his cleverness – which he was now frantically trying to summon, just as he sometimes shook his old, worn-out watch to get it working again. Thank goodness, it wasn't as if they were short on cleverness. And given their combined skills, it would be a poor reflection on their abilities, however limited, if they had to surrender so early. It wasn't really that he saw defeat as a complete loss of their chances; instead, he thought of it – which was bad enough – as some kind of vanity, some foolishness, in the idea of convincing Mrs. Lowder. When, soon after, he was waiting for her in her huge drawing-room – the apartments at Lancaster Gate had struck him as enormous from the very beginning – at her request, conveyed in a "reply-paid" telegram, his theory was that they would still cling to their idea, although with a heightened sense of the difficulty of it, really enlarged to the scale of the place.</i></p></div>

<p>
He had the place for a long time—it seemed to
him a quarter of an hour—to himself; and while
Aunt Maud kept him and kept him, while observation
and reflection crowded on him, he asked himself
what was to be expected of a person who could
treat one like that. The visit, the hour were of
her own proposing, so that her delay, no doubt,
was but part of a general plan of putting him to
inconvenience. As he walked to and fro, however,
taking in the message of her massive, florid furniture,
the immense expression of her signs and symbols,
he had as little doubt of the inconvenience he
was prepared to suffer. He found himself even facing
the thought that he had nothing to fall back
on, and that that was as great a humiliation in a
good cause as a proud man could desire. It had
not yet been so distinct to him that he made no
show—literally not the smallest; so complete a
show seemed made there all about him; so almost
abnormally affirmative, so aggressively erect, were
the huge, heavy objects that syllabled his hostess
story. "When all's said and done, you know, she's
colossally vulgar"—he had once all but said that
of Mrs. Lowder to her niece; only just keeping it
back at the last, keeping it to himself with all its
danger about it. It mattered because it bore so
directly, and he at all events quite felt it a thing that
Kate herself would some day bring out to him. It
bore directly at present, and really all the more that
somehow, strangely, it didn't in the least imply that
Aunt Maud was dull or stale. She was vulgar with
freshness, almost with beauty, since there was
beauty, to a degree, in the play of so big and bold
a temperament. She was in fine quite the largest
possible quantity to deal with; and he was in the
cage of the lioness without his whip—the whip, in a
word, of a supply of proper retorts. He had no
retort but that he loved the girl—which in such a
house as that was painfully cheap. Kate had mentioned
to him more than once that her aunt was
Passionate, speaking of it as a kind of offset and
uttering it as with a capital P, marking it as something
that he might, that he in fact ought to, turn
about in some way to their advantage. He wondered
at this hour to what advantage he could turn
it; but the case grew less simple the longer he
waited. Decidedly there was something he hadn't
enough of. He stood as one fast.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He had the place to himself for a long time—it felt like only fifteen minutes—and while he was alone, waiting for Aunt Maud, and while he was observing everything around him and thinking, he wondered what to expect from someone who could treat him this way. The visit, the appointment, was her idea, so her lateness was probably just part of a plan to inconvenience him. But as he paced back and forth, taking in the message of her massive, ornate furniture, the overwhelming statement of her décor, he didn't doubt that he was prepared to be inconvenienced. He even realized that he had nothing to fall back on, and that it was as great a humiliation in a good cause as a proud man could want. He hadn't fully acknowledged that he was putting on no act—literally not even a small one. The place was so full of her presence. The huge, heavy objects were so assertive, so overwhelmingly imposing, and told the story of his hostess. "When it comes down to it, you know, she's incredibly vulgar"—he'd almost said that about Mrs. Lowder to her niece, but he'd stopped himself at the last moment, keeping the thought to himself because it was so risky. It mattered because it was so relevant, and he felt it was something that Kate herself would eventually say to him. It was relevant now, and even more so because, strangely, it didn't mean that Aunt Maud was boring or stale. She was vulgar in a fresh way, almost beautiful, because there was a degree of beauty in the display of such a big and bold personality. She was, in short, the largest possible challenge to deal with; and he was in the lioness's cage without a whip—the whip, in other words, of clever comebacks. His only comeback was that he loved the girl—which was painfully inadequate in a house like this. Kate had mentioned to him more than once that her aunt was passionate, treating it as a contrast and emphasizing it with a capital P, implying it was something that he might, that he actually should, use to their advantage somehow. He wondered at this moment how he could use it to his advantage, but the situation became less clear the longer he waited. There was definitely something he lacked. He felt trapped.</i></p></div>

<p>
His slow march to and fro seemed to give him
the very measure; as he paced and paced the distance
it became the desert of his poverty; at the
sight of which expanse moreover he could pretend
to himself as little as before that the desert looked
redeemable. Lancaster Gate looked rich—that was
all the effect; which it was unthinkable that any
state of his own should ever remotely resemble. He
read more vividly, more critically, as has been
hinted, the appearances about him; and they did
nothing so much as make him wonder at his aesthetic
reaction. He hadn't known—and in spite
of Kate's repeated reference to her own rebellions
of taste—that he should "mind" so much how an
independent lady might decorate her house. It was
the language of the house itself that spoke to him,
writing out for him, with surpassing breadth and
freedom, the associations and conceptions, the
ideals and possibilities of the mistress. Never, he
flattered himself, had he seen anything so gregariously
ugly—operatively, ominously so cruel. He
was glad to have found this last name for the whole
character; "cruel" somehow played into the subject
for an article—that his impression put straight
into his mind. He would write about the heavy
horrors that could still flourish, that lifted their
undiminished heads, in an age so proud of its short
way with false gods; and it would be funny if what
he should have got from Mrs. Lowder were to
prove, after all, but a small amount of copy. Yet
the great thing, really the dark thing, was that, even
while he thought of the quick column he might
add up, he felt it less easy to laugh at the heavy
horrors than to quail before them. He couldn't
describe and dismiss them collectively, call them
either Mid-Victorian or Early; not being at all sure
they were rangeable under one rubric. It was only
manifest they were splendid and were furthermore
conclusively British. They constituted an order and
they abounded in rare material—precious woods,
metals, stuffs, stones. He had never dreamed of
anything so fringed and scalloped, so buttoned and
corded, drawn everywhere so tight, and curled
everywhere so thick. He had never dreamed of so
much gilt and glass, so much satin and plush, so
much rosewood and marble and malachite. But it
was, above all, the solid forms, the wasted finish,
the misguided cost, the general attestation of morality
and money, a good conscience and a big balance.
These things finally represented for him a
portentous negation of his own world of thought—of
which, for that matter, in the presence of them,
he became as for the first time hopelessly aware.
They revealed it to him by their merciless difference.
His interview with Aunt Maud, none the less,
took by no means the turn he had expected. Passionate
though her nature, no doubt Mrs. Lowder,
on this occasion, neither threatened nor appealed.
Her arms of aggression, her weapons of defence,
were presumably close at hand, but she left them
untouched and unmentioned, and was in fact so
bland that he properly perceived only afterwards
how adroit she had been. He properly perceived
something else as well, which complicated his case;
he shouldn't have known what to call it if he hadn't
called it her really imprudent good-nature. Her
blandness, in other words, was not mere policy—he
wasn't dangerous enough for policy; it was the result,
he could see, of her fairly liking him a little.
From the moment she did that she herself became
more interesting; and who knew what might happen
should he take to liking <i>her?</i> Well, it was a
risk he naturally must face. She fought him, at
any rate, but with one hand, with a few loose grains
of stray powder. He recognised at the end of ten
minutes, and even without her explaining it, that
if she had made him wait it had not been to wound
him; they had by that time almost directly met
on the fact of her intention. She had wanted him
to think for himself of what she proposed to say
to him—not having otherwise announced it;
wanted to let it come home to him on the spot, as
she had shrewdly believed it would. Her first question,
on appearing, had practically been as to
whether he hadn't taken her hint, and this inquiry
assumed so many things that it made discussion, immediately,
frank and large. He knew, with the
question put, that the hint was just what he <i>had</i>
taken; knew that she had made him quickly forgive
her the display of her power; knew that if he didn't
take care he should understand her, and the
strength of her purpose, to say nothing of that of
her imagination, nothing of the length of her purse,
only too well. Yet he pulled himself up with the
thought, too, that he was not going to be afraid of
understanding her; he was just going to understand
and understand without detriment to the feeblest,
even, of his passions. The play of one's mind let
one in, at the best, dreadfully, in action, in the need
of action, where simplicity was all; but when one
couldn't prevent it the thing was to make it complete.
There would never be mistakes but for the
original fun of mistakes. What he must use his
fatal intelligence for was to resist. Mrs. Lowder,
meanwhile, might use it for whatever she liked.

He couldn't describe them all and dismiss them, calling them either Mid-Victorian or Early Victorian, not being sure they could be categorized under a single label. It was obvious, however, that they were grand and definitively British. They represented a certain standard and were full of luxurious materials—precious woods, metals, fabrics, and stones. He had never seen anything so fringed and scalloped, so buttoned and corded, so tightly drawn and thickly curled everywhere. He had never seen so much gold and glass, so much satin and plush, so much rosewood and marble and malachite.

He also realized something else, which complicated things; he wouldn't have known what to call it if he hadn't called it her genuinely imprudent kindness. In other words, her pleasantness wasn't just a tactic—he wasn't dangerous enough for her to need to use tactics. He could see that it was the result of her actually liking him a little. From that moment, she herself became more interesting. And who knew what might happen if he started to like her? It was a risk he had to face, of course. She was fighting him, but only with one hand, using a few loose grains of stray powder. He realized after ten minutes, even without her explaining it, that if she had kept him waiting, it wasn't to hurt him. They had essentially agreed on her intentions. She wanted him to figure out for himself what she was going to say to him—not having announced it directly. She wanted him to understand it on the spot, as she cleverly believed he would.

He knew that the question implied that he had understood the hint, that she had made him forgive her the display of her power, and that if he wasn't careful, he would understand her, the strength of her purpose, not to mention her imagination and the size of her fortune, far too well. Yet he also reminded himself that he wasn't going to be afraid of understanding her. He was simply going to understand, without hindering even the weakest of his passions. Using one's mind can make a person disastrously complicated when it comes to action, and the need for simplicity. But when you can't prevent it, the thing to do is embrace it fully. Mistakes are the source of all the original fun. What he must use his dangerous intelligence for was to resist. Meanwhile, Mrs. Lowder could use her intelligence however she wanted.</i></p></div>

It was after she had begun her statement of her
own idea about Kate that he began, on his side, to
reflect that—with her manner of offering it as really
sufficient if he would take the trouble to embrace—it
she couldn't half hate him. That was all, positively,
she seemed to show herself for the time as
attempting; clearly, if she did her intention justice,
she would have nothing more disagreeable to
do. "If I hadn't been ready to go very much
further, you understand, I wouldn't have gone so
far. I don't care what you repeat to her—the more
you repeat to her, perhaps the better; and, at any
rate, there's nothing she doesn't already know. I
don't say it for her; I say it for you—when I want
to reach my niece I know how to do it straight."
So Aunt Maud delivered herself—as with homely
benevolence, in the simplest, but the clearest terms;
virtually conveying that, though a word to the wise
was, doubtless, in spite of the advantage, <i>not</i> always
enough, a word to the good could never fail to be.
The sense our young man read into her words was
that she liked him because he was good—was really,
by her measure, good enough: good enough, that
is, to give up her niece for her and go his way in
peace. But <i>was</i> he good enough—by his own
measure? He fairly wondered, while she more fully
expressed herself, if it might be his doom to prove
so. "She's the finest possible creature—of course
you flatter yourself that you know it. But I know
it, quite as well as you possibly can—by which I
mean a good deal better yet; and the tune to which
I'm ready to prove my faith compares favourably
enough, I think, with anything <i>you</i> can do. I don't
say it because she's my niece—that's nothing to me:
I might have had fifty nieces, and I wouldn't have
brought one of them to this place if I hadn't found
her to my taste. I don't say I wouldn't have done
something else, but I wouldn't have put up with
her presence. Kate's presence, by good fortune,
I marked early; Kate's presence—unluckily for <i>you</i>—is
everything I could possibly wish; Kate's presence
is, in short, as fine as you know, and I've been
keeping it for the comfort of my declining years.
I've watched it long; I've been saving it up and
letting it, as you say of investments, appreciate, and
you may judge whether, now it has begun to pay
so, I'm likely to consent to treat for it with any
but a high bidder. I can do the best with her, and
I've my idea of the best."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>After she'd started explaining her thoughts about Kate, he began to realize, on his end, that she seemed to think he should simply accept her ideas. She seemed to really hate him for it. That was all she appeared to be trying to do at the moment; clearly, if she truly got her way, she wouldn't have anything more unpleasant to deal with. "If I wasn't prepared to go pretty far, understand, I wouldn't have gone this far. I don't care what you tell her—the more you tell her, the better, perhaps; and at any rate, she already knows everything. I'm not saying this for her; I'm saying it for you—I know how to reach my niece directly when I want to."</i></p><p><i>That's how Aunt Maud spoke—with simple, clear kindness, as if to say that while a wise person might not always understand, a good person would never fail.</i></p><p><i>Our young man interpreted her words as meaning she liked him because he was a good person—good enough, in her opinion: good enough, that is, to give up her niece for her and let him go his own way. But was he good enough, according to his own standards? He wondered if he was destined to prove it, as she continued to speak. "She's the most wonderful person—of course you think you realize that. But I know it just as well as you do, maybe even better; and I'm as committed to proving my love as you are. I'm not saying this because she's my niece—that doesn't matter to me: I could have had fifty nieces, and I wouldn't have brought any of them here if I hadn't liked them. I won't say I wouldn't have done something else, but I wouldn't have put up with her being around. Luckily for me, I noticed Kate's presence early on; unfortunately for you, Kate's presence is everything I could want; Kate's presence is, in short, as amazing as you know, and I've been keeping it for myself. I've watched her for a long time; I've been saving her up, letting her, as you would say of investments, appreciate in value, and you can imagine whether I'm likely to let her go for anything less than a very high price now that she's finally started paying off.

It was an oddity of Mrs. Lowder's that her face
in speech was like a lighted window at night, but
that silence immediately drew the curtain. The

She gave him so, on this, the mere effect of the
drawn blind that it quite forced him, at first, into the
sense, possibly just, of having affected her as flippant,
perhaps even as low. He had been looked
at so, in blighted moments of presumptuous youth,
by big cold public men, but never, so far as he
could recall, by any private lady. More than anything
yet it gave him the measure of his companion's
subtlety, and thereby of Kate's possible career.
"Don't be <i>too</i> impossible!"—he feared from his
friend, for a moment, some such answer as that;
and then felt, as she spoke otherwise, as if she were
letting him off easily. "I want her to marry a great
man." That was all; but, more and more, it was
enough; and if it hadn't been her next words would
have made it so. "And I think of her what I think.
There you are."

He'd been judged like that before, in humiliating moments of his youth, by important, distant men, but never, as far as he could remember, by a woman. More than anything, this gave him a clear understanding of her intelligence, and thus, of what Kate’s future might be.</i></p><p><i>“Don’t be ridiculous!” He almost expected her to say something like that.

They sat for a little face to face upon it, and he
was conscious of something deeper still, of something
she wished him to understand if he only
would. To that extent she did appeal—appealed
to the intelligence she desired to show she believed
him to possess. He was meanwhile, at all events,
not the man wholly to fail of comprehension. "Of
course I'm aware how little I can answer to any
fond, proud dream. You've a view—a magnificent
one; into which I perfectly enter. I thoroughly understand
what I'm not, and I'm much obliged to
you for not reminding me of it in any rougher
way." She said nothing—she kept that up; it
might even have been to let him go further, if he
was capable of it, in the way of poorness of spirit.
It was one of those cases in which a man couldn't
show, if he showed at all, save for poor; unless
indeed he preferred to show for asinine. It was
the plain truth: he <i>was</i>—on Mrs. Lowder's basis,
the only one in question—a very small quantity,
and he did know, damnably, what made quantities
large. He desired to be perfectly simple; yet in
the midst of that effort a deeper apprehension
throbbed. Aunt Maud clearly conveyed it, though
he couldn't later on have said how. "You don't
really matter, I believe, so much as you think, and
I'm not going to make you a martyr by banishing
you. Your performances with Kate in the Park are
ridiculous so far as they're meant as consideration
for me; and I had much rather see you myself—since
you're, in your way, my dear young man, delightful—and
arrange with you, count with you,
as I easily, as I perfectly should. Do you suppose
me so stupid as to quarrel with you if it's not really
necessary? It won't—it would be too absurd!—<i>be</i>
necessary. I can bite your head off any day, any day
I really open my mouth; and I'm dealing with
you now, see—and successfully judge—without
opening it. I do things handsomely all round—I
place you in the presence of the plan with which,
from the moment it's a case of taking you seriously,
you're incompatible. Come then as near it as you
like, walk all round it—don't be afraid you'll hurt
it!—and live on with it before you."

In a way, she was appealing to him – appealing to the intelligence she wanted to believe he possessed. He, for his part, wasn't entirely oblivious. "Of course, I realize how little I can live up to any grand, idealistic expectations. You have a vision – a magnificent one; and I totally get it. I fully understand what I'm not, and I appreciate you not pointing it out in a harsher way." She didn't say anything, which she continued to do; maybe it was to let him say more, if he was capable of being even more humble. It was one of those situations where a person could only come across as insignificant, unless, of course, they wanted to appear foolish. The simple truth was that he – according to Mrs. Lowder’s standards, the only ones that mattered – was a nobody, and he knew, damn it, what made people important. He wanted to be completely straightforward, but even in trying to do so, a deeper concern resonated. Aunt Maud made it clear, although he couldn't later pinpoint how. "I don't believe you're as significant as you think, and I'm not going to punish you by sending you away. Your little escapades with Kate in the park are ridiculous if you think they're some kind of consideration for me; and I'd much rather see you myself – since, in your own way, you're, my dear young man, quite charming – and deal with you, involve you, as I easily and perfectly can. Do you think I'm so foolish as to argue with you if it's not absolutely necessary? It won't be – it would be too silly! – necessary. I can dismiss you anytime, the moment I actually speak my mind; and I'm dealing with you now, see? And I’m succeeding – without saying a word. I do things elegantly – I’m putting you right in front of the plan, with which, from the moment I start taking you seriously, you can’t possibly fit in.

He afterwards felt that if she hadn't absolutely
phrased all this it was because she so soon made
him out as going with her far enough. He was so
pleasantly affected by her asking no promise of him,
her not proposing he should pay for her indulgence
by his word of honour not to interfere, that he gave
her a kind of general assurance of esteem. Immediately
afterwards, then, he spoke of these things
to Kate, and what then came back to him first of
all was the way he had said to her—he mentioned
it to the girl—very much as one of a pair of lovers
says in a rupture by mutual consent: "I hope immensely,
of course, that you'll always regard me as
a friend." This had perhaps been going far—he
submitted it all to Kate; but really there had been
so much in it that it was to be looked at, as they
might say, wholly in its own light. Other things
than those we have presented had come up before
the close of his scene with Aunt Maud, but this matter
of her not treating him as a peril of the first
order easily predominated. There was moreover
plenty to talk about on the occasion of his subsequent
passage with our young woman, it having
been put to him abruptly, the night before, that he
might give himself a lift and do his newspaper a
service—so flatteringly was the case expressed—by
going, for fifteen or twenty weeks, to America.
The idea of a series of letters from the United States
from the strictly social point of view had for some
time been nursed in the inner sanctuary at whose
door he sat, and the moment was now deemed
happy for letting it loose. The imprisoned thought
had, in a word, on the opening of the door, flown
straight out into Densher's face, or perched at least
on his shoulder, making him look up in surprise
from his mere inky office-table. His account of
the matter to Kate was that he couldn't refuse—not
being in a position, as yet, to refuse anything; but
that his being chosen for such an errand confounded
his sense of proportion. He was definite as to his
scarce knowing how to measure the honour, which
struck him as equivocal; he had not quite supposed
himself the man for the class of job. This confused
consciousness, he intimated, he had promptly
enough betrayed to his manager; with the effect,
however, of seeing the question surprisingly clear
up. What it came to was that the sort of twaddle
that was not in his chords was, unexpectedly, just
what they happened this time not to want. They
wanted his letters, for queer reasons, about as good
as he could let them come; he was to play his own
little tune and not be afraid; that was the whole
point.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Later, he realized that if she hadn't explicitly said everything, it was because she quickly understood he was willing to go along with her. He was so pleased that she didn't ask him for a commitment, that she didn't expect him to promise not to interfere with her, that he gave her a general expression of his respect. Immediately afterward, he discussed these things with Kate. What he remembered first was the way he’d spoken to the woman—he told Kate about it—much like one lover says to another at the end of a relationship, by mutual agreement: “I certainly hope you’ll always think of me as a friend.” Maybe that was too much, he told Kate, but really, it had to be seen on its own terms. Other things had been said before he left Aunt Maud, but the fact that she didn’t treat him as a serious threat was what stuck out most. Moreover, there was plenty to talk about when he later spoke with Kate, because he’d been asked suddenly the night before if he’d consider boosting his career and helping the newspaper—that's how flattering the offer was phrased—by going to America for fifteen or twenty weeks. The idea of a series of social letters from the United States had been brewing in secret for a while, and the time was now right to release it. The hidden thought, once the door opened, had, in other words, flown straight into Densher's face, or at least landed on his shoulder, making him look up in surprise from his desk. He told Kate that he couldn't refuse—he wasn't in a position to refuse anything at the moment—but being chosen for the job felt disproportionate. He was clear that he wasn’t sure how to measure the honor, which seemed uncertain. He hadn't quite thought of himself as the right person for the job. He said he'd been confused, which he'd made clear to his boss. But this had the surprising effect of making everything clearer. It turned out that the kind of superficial writing that he wasn't good at was, unexpectedly, exactly what they didn't want this time. They wanted his letters, for strange reasons, to be as good as he could make them; he should do his own thing and not worry; that was the whole point.</i></p></div>

It would have been the whole, that is, had there
not been a sharper one still in the circumstance that
he was to start at once. His mission, as they called
it at the office, would probably be over by the end
of June, which was desirable; but to bring that
about he must now not lose a week; his inquiries,
he understood, were to cover the whole ground,
and there were reasons of State—reasons operating
at the seat of empire in Fleet Street—why the nail
should be struck on the head. Densher made no
secret to Kate of his having asked for a day to decide;
and his account of that matter was that he
felt he owed it to her to speak to her first. She
assured him on this that nothing so much as that
scruple had yet shown her how they were bound
together; she was clearly proud of his letting a
thing of such importance depend on her; but she
was clearer still as to his instant duty. She rejoiced
in his prospect and urged him to his task; she
should miss him intensely—of course she should
miss him; but she made so little of it that she spoke
with jubilation of what he would see and would
do. She made so much of this last quantity that he
laughed at her innocence, though also with scarce
the heart to give her the real size of his drop in
the daily bucket. He was struck at the same time
with her happy grasp of what had really occurred
in Fleet Street—all the more that it was his own
final reading. He was to pull the subject up—that
was just what they wanted; and it would take
more than all the United States together, visit them
each as he might, to let <i>him</i> down. It was just
because he didn't nose about and wasn't the usual
gossipmonger that they had picked him out; it
was a branch of their correspondence with which
they evidently wished a new tone associated, such
a tone as, from now on, it would have always to
take from his example.

His assignment, as they called it at the office, would likely be finished by the end of June, which was good; but to make that happen, he couldn't waste a week. He understood that his investigation needed to be comprehensive, and there were serious matters – matters concerning the highest levels of power in Fleet Street – that required a definitive answer. Densher told Kate without hesitation that he'd requested a day to think it over, and his reason was that he felt he had to discuss it with her first. She assured him that this hesitation showed her how strong their relationship was; she was clearly pleased that he'd let something so important depend on her, but she was even clearer about his immediate responsibility. She was happy for him and encouraged him to take on the task; she would miss him terribly – of course she would; but she downplayed it so much that she spoke enthusiastically about what he would see and do. She focused so much on the good aspects of it that he laughed at her naivete, though he was reluctant to tell her the full extent of his own disappointment at leaving. He was also impressed by her understanding of what had really happened in Fleet Street – especially since it matched his own understanding. He was supposed to dig up the story – that was precisely what they wanted; and it would take more than all the United States combined, even if he visited every one of them, to let him off the hook. They'd chosen him precisely because he wasn't nosy and wasn't a typical gossip; this was a part of their communication that they clearly wanted to be handled with a fresh approach, an approach that, from now on, would always be modeled on his example.</i></p></div>

She spoke of the future this time as so little
contingent, that he felt a queerness of conscience
in making her the report that he presently arrived
at on what had passed for him with the real
arbiter of their destiny. The way for that had been
blocked a little by his news from Fleet Street; but
in the crucible of their happy discussion this element
soon melted into the other, and in the mixture that
ensued the parts were not to be distinguished. The
young man moreover, before taking his leave, was
to see why Kate had just spoken of the future as
if they now really possessed it, and was to come to
the vision by a devious way that deepened the final
cheer. Their faces were turned to the illumined
quarter as soon as he had answered her question in
respect to the appearance of their being able to
play a waiting game with success. It was for the
possibility of that appearance that she had, a few
days before, so earnestly pressed him to see her
aunt; and if after his hour with that lady it had

But during their joyful conversation, that obstacle quickly dissolved into everything else, and the different parts of the situation were indistinguishable in the end. Before leaving, the young man also wanted to understand why Kate had just talked about the future as if they already controlled it. He was going to reach this understanding through a roundabout way that ultimately increased their happiness. They both looked towards the bright future as soon as he had answered her question about whether they could successfully wait things out. She had strongly urged him to visit her aunt a few days earlier because of the possibility of creating that impression. And if Densher hadn't realized after meeting her aunt that he'd had the best possible outcome, the discouraging facts suddenly took on a more positive meaning as Kate addressed them one by one.</i></p></div>

"It <i>is</i> everything; everything <i>she</i> thinks it. It's
the probability—I mean as Mrs. Lowder measures
probability—that I may be prevented from becoming
a complication for her by some arrangement,
<i>any</i> arrangement, through which you shall see me
often and easily. She's sure of my want of money,
and that gives her time. She believes in my having
a certain amount of delicacy, in my wishing to better
my state before I put the pistol to your head
in respect to sharing it. The time that will take
figures for her as the time that will help her if she
doesn't spoil her chance by treating me badly. She
doesn't at all wish moreover," Densher went on,
"to treat me badly, for I believe, upon my honour,
funny as it may sound to you, that she personally
rather likes me, and that if you weren't in question
I might almost become her pet young man. She
doesn't disparage intellect and culture—quite the
contrary; she wants them to adorn her board and
be named in her programme; and I'm sure it has
sometimes cost her a real pang that I should be so
desirable, at once, and so impossible." He paused
a moment, and his companion then saw that a
strange smile was in his face—a smile as strange
even as the adjunct, in her own, of this informing
vision. "I quite suspect her of believing that, if
the truth were known, she likes me literally better
than—deep down—you yourself do: wherefore she
does me the honour to think that I may be safely
left to kill my own cause. There, as I say, comes in
her margin. I'm not the sort of stuff of romance
that wears, that washes, that survives use, that resists
familiarity. Once in any degree admit that,
and your pride and prejudice will take care of the
rest! the pride fed full, meanwhile, by the system
she means to practise with you, and the prejudice
excited by the comparison she'll enable you to
make, from which I shall come off badly. She likes
me, but she'll never like me so much as when she
succeeded a little better in making me look
wretched. For then <i>you'll</i> like me less."

She thinks I have a certain level of decency and that I’ll want to improve my situation before I pressure you into sharing your money. That amount of time is helpful to her, if she doesn't ruin her chances by treating me poorly. Also, Densher continued, "she really doesn't want to treat me badly. I honestly believe, and it may sound strange, that she actually likes me, and if you weren’t involved, I might almost become her favorite young man. She values intelligence and culture – quite the opposite; she wants them around her and mentioned in her social circle. I'm sure it's sometimes been a real problem for her that I'm so appealing, yet so unavailable." He paused, and his companion noticed a peculiar smile on his face, as unusual as the revelation he was offering her. "I suspect she actually believes that, if the truth were known, she likes me, deep down, more than *you* do. So, she's flattering me by thinking I can be trusted to ruin my own chances. That's where her wiggle room is. I'm not the kind of romantic figure that lasts, that withstands the test of time, that remains desirable after familiarity.

"Yes, aren't they?" the girl returned; and they
had, over all that aspect of their wonderful lady,
one of those deep and free interchanges that made
everything but confidence a false note for them.
There were complications, there were questions;
but they were so much more together than they
were anything else. Kate uttered for a while no
word of refutation of Aunt Maud's "big" diplomacy,
and they left it there, as they would have left
any other fine product, for a monument to her
powers. But, Densher related further, he had had
in other respects too the car of Juggernaut to face;
he omitted nothing from his account of his visit,
least of all the way Aunt Maud had frankly at last—though
indeed only under artful pressure—fallen
foul of his very type, his want of the right marks,
his foreign accidents, his queer antecedents. She
had told him he was but half a Briton, which, he
granted Kate, would have been dreadful if he hadn't
so let himself in for it.

He described his visit in detail, especially how Aunt Maud had finally and honestly—though only after some clever prodding—criticized him, his lack of the right social standing, his foreign background, and his past.

half an hour, on as much of the picture of his early
years abroad, his migratory parents, his Swiss
schools, his German university, as she had easy
attention for. A man, he intimated, a man of their
world, would have spotted him straight as to many
of these points; a man of their world, so far as
they had a world, would have been through the
English mill. But it was none the less charming
to make his confession to a woman; women had,
in fact, for such differences, so much more imagination.
Kate showed at present all his case could require;
when she had had it from beginning to end
she declared that she now made out more than ever
yet of what she loved him for. She had herself,
as a child, lived with some continuity in the world
across the Channel, coming home again still a child;
and had participated after that, in her teens, in her
mother's brief but repeated retreats to Dresden, to
Florence, to Biarritz, weak and expensive attempts
at economy from which there stuck to her—though
in general coldly expressed, through the instinctive
avoidance of cheap raptures—the religion of foreign
things. When it was revealed to her how
many more foreign things were in Merton Densher
than he had hitherto taken the trouble to catalogue,
she almost faced him as if he were a map of the
continent or a handsome present of a delightful
new "Murray." He hadn't meant to swagger, he
had rather meant to plead, though with Mrs. Lowder
he had meant also a little to explain. His
father had been, in strange countries, in twenty settlements
of the English, British chaplain, resident
or occasional, and had had for years the unusual
luck of never wanting a billet. His career abroad
had therefore been unbroken, and, as his stipend
had never been great, he had educated his children
at the smallest cost, in the schools nearest; which
was also a saving of railway fares. Densher's
mother, it further appeared, had practised on her
side a distinguished industry, to the success of which—so
far as success ever crowned it—this period of
exile had much contributed: she copied, patient
lady, famous pictures in great museums, having
begun with a happy natural gift and taking in betimes
the scale of her opportunity. Copyists abroad
of course swarmed, but Mrs. Densher had had a
sense and a hand of her own, had arrived at a perfection
that persuaded, that even deceived, and that
made the disposal of her work blissfully usual. Her
son, who had lost her, held her image sacred, and
the effect of his telling Kate all about her, as well
as about other matters until then mixed and dim,
was to render his history rich, his sources full, his
outline anything but common. He had come
round, he had come back, he insisted abundantly, to
being a Briton: his Cambridge years, his happy
connection, as it had proved, with his father's college,
amply certified to that, to say nothing of his
subsequent plunge into London, which filled up
the measure. But brave enough though his descent
to English earth, he had passed, by the way, through
zones of air that had left their ruffle on his wings,
had been exposed to initiations ineffaceable. Something
had happened to him that could never be
undone.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Oh yes, we definitely need to keep her happy!" his friend agreed. Those words probably summarized their immediate understanding of the strategic advantage Densher had gained. They had a lot to deal with before he left for New York, and the situation he was discussing now was primarily relevant to Kate. She looked at him as if he'd revealed more about his personal history to her aunt than he'd ever shared with her. If that was the case, it was unintentional, and it led him to describe his early years abroad—his nomadic parents, his Swiss schools, his German university—for about half an hour, to the extent that she was interested. He suggested that someone from their social circle would immediately recognize those aspects of his background, someone who had gone through the established English education system. However, it was still enjoyable to confide in a woman; women, in his experience, had a greater capacity for understanding those kinds of differences. Kate showed the appropriate level of interest, and after hearing the whole story, she said she now understood even more why she loved him. She herself had spent time living in Europe as a child, returning to England while still young. Later, during her teens, she had joined her mother on several short trips to places like Dresden, Florence, and Biarritz. These were financially limited attempts at travel, but they instilled in her—although she generally avoided expressing excessive enthusiasm—a fondness for foreign cultures. When she realized how many more foreign influences there were in Merton Densher than he'd previously mentioned, she almost looked at him as if he were a map of Europe or an appealing new "Murray's Guidebook." He hadn't intended to boast; he'd actually wanted to explain himself, though he had also wanted to provide some context for Mrs. Lowder. His father had been a British chaplain in various foreign locations, both as a resident and on occasion, and had been fortunate enough to have a consistent income for many years. His career abroad was therefore continuous, and since his salary wasn't high, he educated his children in the most affordable schools nearby, which also saved money on transportation. Densher's mother had also been remarkably industrious. Her success—to the extent that she achieved it—was largely due to this period of living abroad. She was a patient woman who copied famous paintings in major museums, using a natural talent and recognizing the opportunities available to her. Copyists were common abroad, but Mrs. Densher had skill and artistry, achieving a level of perfection that was convincing, even deceptive, and made selling her work easy. His son, who had lost her, cherished her memory, and the effect of telling Kate all this about her, as well as about other things previously vague and unclear, was to make his background richer, his origins more interesting, and his story anything but ordinary. He had become a true Briton again, he insisted repeatedly; his time at Cambridge, and his fortunate association with his father's college, proved that, not to mention his subsequent immersion in London life, which completed the process. Although he was fully English now, he had also experienced influences that left their mark on him, exposures that would never be erased. Something had happened to him that could never be undone.</i></p></div>

When Kate Croy said to him as much he besought
her not to insist, declaring that this indeed
was what was too much the matter with him, that
he had been but too probably spoiled for native, for
insular use. On which, not unnaturally, she insisted
the more, assuring him, without mitigation, that if
he was complicated and brilliant she wouldn't for
the world have had him any thing less; so that he
was reduced in the end to accusing her of putting
the dreadful truth to him in the hollow guise of
flattery. She was making out how abnormal he was
in order that she might eventually find him impossible;
and, as she could fully make it out but
with his aid, she had to bribe him by feigned delight
to help her. If her last word for him, in the
connection, was that the way he saw himself was
just a precious proof the more of his having tasted
of the tree and being thereby prepared to assist her
to eat, this gives the happy tone of their whole
talk, the measure of the flight of time in the near
presence of his settled departure. Kate showed,
however, that she was to be more literally taken
when she spoke of the relief Aunt Maud would draw
from the prospect of his absence.

Naturally, she pushed harder, telling him flatly that she wouldn't want him any other way if he wasn't complex and fascinating. He ended up accusing her of using flattery to tell him the awful truth. She was painting him as abnormal so she could eventually reject him. Since she couldn't fully understand it without his help, she was trying to trick him into helping by pretending to be pleased. When she finally said that his self-awareness was just proof that he'd "tasted of the tree" and was ready to help her "eat," that perfectly captured the lighthearted tone of their entire conversation, and showed how quickly time was passing before he left. However, Kate also proved she was being serious when she mentioned how relieved Aunt Maud would be when he was gone.</i></p></div>

He went on with that fantasy, but at this point
Kate ceased to attend. He saw after a little that
she had been following some thought of her own,
and he had been feeling the growth of something
determinant even through the extravagance of
much of the pleasantry, the warm, transparent irony,
into which their livelier intimacy kept plunging like

The beauty was in everything, and he could have
separated nothing—couldn't have thought of her
face as distinct from the whole joy. Yet her face
had a new light. "And I pledge you—I call God
to witness!—every spark of my faith; I give you
every drop of my life." That was all, for the moment,
but it was enough, and it was almost as quiet
as if it were nothing. They were in the open air,
in an alley of the Gardens; the great space, which
seemed to arch just then higher and spread wider
for them, threw them back into deep concentration.
They moved by a common instinct to a spot,
within sight, that struck them as fairly sequestered,
and there, before their time together was spent,
they had extorted from concentration every advance
it could make them. They had exchanged
vows and tokens, sealed their rich compact, solemnized,
so far as breathed words and murmured sounds
and lighted eyes and clasped hands could do it, their
agreement to belong only, and to belong tremendously,
to each other. They were to leave the place
accordingly an affianced couple; but before they
left it other things still had passed. Densher had
declared his horror of bringing to a premature end
her happy relation with her aunt; and they had
worked round together to a high level of wisdom
and patience. Kate's free profession was that she
wished not to deprive <i>him</i> of Mrs. Lowder's countenance,
which, in the long run, she was convinced
he would continue to enjoy; and as, by a blessed
turn, Aunt Maud had demanded of him no promise
that would tie his hands, they should be able to
cultivate their destiny in their own way and yet remain
loyal. One difficulty alone stood out, which
Densher named.

They were outside, in a path in the Gardens; the vast space seemed to arch higher and spread wider just for them, drawing them into deep focus.

They had exchanged promises and gifts, sealed their agreement, and declared, with their words and whispers and shining eyes and clasped hands, that they were committed to belonging to each other completely. They were to leave the Gardens as an engaged couple; but before they left, other things had happened. Densher had said he didn't want to ruin her happy relationship with her aunt, and they had worked things out together with great understanding and patience. Kate freely stated that she didn't want to deprive him of Mrs. Lowder's support, which she was sure he would continue to have; and since, fortunately, Aunt Maud hadn't made him promise anything that would limit him, they could pursue their future as they pleased while still being loyal.

silence that looked out for them both at the far

they thus took final possession of it. They were

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Two ladies, Mrs. Stringham and Milly Theale, travel together through the Brünig pass in Switzerland. They had previously met in Boston, after which Mrs. Stringham visited Milly in New York. Following the visit, Milly sent a telegram proposing an immediate, unconditional trip to Europe, which Mrs. Stringham accepted. They traveled by sea to Naples and then made their way through Italy and over the Alps.</p><p>While on the Brünig, they stop for lunch and agree to prolong their stay. Milly leaves Mrs. Stringham to make the arrangements for lodging and their carriage. Milly then takes a book and strolls off. After an hour, Mrs. Stringham goes to find her. She follows a path up a hillside and past some chalets, where an old woman indicates the direction Milly took. Mrs. Stringham continues on and finds Milly's book lying on a rock.</p><p>From her position, she sees Milly sitting on a rock slab at the edge of a precipice. Mrs. Stringham watches her for several minutes without revealing her presence. She then quietly withdraws. After waiting for some time, she returns to the path where the book is, writes "à bientôt!" on its cover with a pencil, and goes back to the inn. Late in the afternoon, Milly reappears.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study.</p><p>### Mrs. Susan Stringham
</p><ul><li>**Initial Presentation:** Mrs. Stringham is a middle-aged, childless New England widow and a writer of modest reputation. She presents herself as a "woman of the world" due to a European education in her youth, and she leads a structured, intellectually-inclined life in Boston. She is self-aware, observant, and prone to "shy conceits," living a life more of refined observation than of direct, passionate experience.</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically upon meeting Milly Theale. Her quiet, ordered life is completely upended. She renounces her own ambitions to become Milly’s devoted companion, shifting her role from an independent woman to a self-appointed "confidant." This new relationship forces her into a state of constant, "secretive" observation and analysis, which she recognizes is contrary to her nature. Her perception culminates in a moment of terror on the mountain, which then resolves into a "revelation": she no longer sees Milly as merely restless but as a grand figure confronting a profound and complex destiny.</li><p>### Milly Theale
</p><li>**Initial Presentation:** Milly is presented almost exclusively through Mrs. Stringham’s admiring and bewildered eyes. She is a young, strikingly unconventional New Yorker, described as "slim, pale, delicately haggard" with exceptional red hair and dressed in mourning. She is an orphan of immense wealth who has suffered numerous bereavements. Characterized by a "charming, ambiguous oddity," she is at once restlessly impatient, inexplicably sad, and charmingly gay. To Mrs. Stringham, she is a "princess" who seems tragically inexperienced and "starved for culture."</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** The narrative begins with Milly successfully undertaking a European tour against advice. Her situation, however, shifts from that of a wealthy, melancholy tourist to something far more serious. Her solitary contemplation on a dangerous cliff edge transforms her from a figure of romantic restlessness into one of immense gravity. The ambiguity surrounding her "unpacified state" sharpens into the impression that she is consciously facing "the whole assault of life," and is reserved for a "complicated passage" rather than a simple resolution.</li></ul>

The two ladies who, in advance of the Swiss
season, had been warned that their design
was unconsidered, that the passes would not be
clear, nor the air mild, nor the inns open—the two
ladies who, characteristically, had braved a good
deal of possibly interested remonstrance were finding
themselves, as their adventure turned out, wonderfully
sustained. It was the judgment of the
head-waiters and other functionaries on the Italian
lakes that approved itself now as interested; they
themselves had been conscious of impatiences, of
bolder dreams—at least the younger had; so that
one of the things they made out together—making
out as they did an endless variety—was that in
those operatic palaces of the Villa d'Este, of Cadenabbia,
of Pallanza and Stresa, lone women, however
reinforced by a travelling-library of instructive
volumes, were apt to be beguiled and undone.
Their flights of fancy moreover had been modest;
they had for instance risked nothing vital in hoping
to make their way by the Brünig. They were
making it in fact happily enough as we meet them,
and were only wishing that, for the wondrous
beauty of the early high-climbing spring, it might
have been longer and the places to pause and rest
more numerous.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The two women, who had been warned before their trip to Switzerland that their plans were ill-advised, that the mountain passes wouldn't be clear, the weather wouldn't be mild, and the inns wouldn't be open—the two women who, as usual, had ignored a lot of potentially helpful advice—were finding their adventure to be surprisingly enjoyable. The negative opinions of the head waiters and staff at the Italian lakes were now proving to be self-serving; the women suspected they’d been jealous, had bigger ambitions of their own—at least the younger one had. One of the things they discussed together, among many other topics, was how single women, even those armed with a traveling library of educational books, were often deceived and taken advantage of in the opulent settings of the Villa d'Este, Cadenabbia, Pallanza, and Stresa. Their goals had been relatively simple; for example, they hadn't risked anything serious by hoping to travel through the Brünig Pass. They were actually having a great time as we find them, and only wished that the stunning beauty of the early spring in the mountains could have lasted longer, and that there had been more places to stop and rest.</i></p></div>

Such at least had been the intimated attitude of
Mrs. Stringham, the elder of the companions, who
had her own view of the impatiences of the
younger, to which, however, she offered an opposition
but of the most circuitous. She moved, the
admirable Mrs. Stringham, in a fine cloud of observation
and suspicion; she was in the position,
as she believed, of knowing much more about Milly
Theale than Milly herself knew, and yet of having
to darken her knowledge as well as make it active.
The woman in the world least formed by nature, as
she was quite aware, for duplicities and labyrinths,
she found herself dedicated to personal subtlety by
a new set of circumstances, above all by a new personal
relation; had now in fact to recognise that an
education in the occult—she could scarce say what
to call it—had begun for her the day she left New
York with Mildred. She had come on from Boston
for that purpose; had seen little of the girl—or
rather had seen her but briefly, for Mrs. Stringham,
when she saw anything at all, saw much, saw
everything—before accepting her proposal; and
had accordingly placed herself, by her act, in a boat
that she more and more estimated as, humanly
speaking, of the biggest, though likewise, no
doubt, in many ways, by reason of its size, of the
safest. In Boston, the winter before, the young
lady in whom we are interested had, on the spot,
deeply, yet almost tacitly, appealed to her, dropped
into her mind the shy conceit of some assistance,
some devotion to render. Mrs. Stringham's little
life had often been visited by shy conceits—secret
dreams that had fluttered their hour between its
narrow walls without, for any great part, so much
as mustering courage to look out of its rather dim
windows. But this imagination—the fancy of a
possible link with the remarkable young thing from
New York—<i>had</i> mustered courage: had perched,
on the instant, at the clearest look-out it could find,
and might be said to have remained there till, only
a few months later, it had caught, in surprise and
joy, the unmistakable flash of a signal.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>At least, that's what Mrs. Stringham, the older of the two, seemed to think. She had her own opinions about the younger woman's impatience, but she only resisted it in very subtle ways. Mrs. Stringham was a keen observer, always suspicious; she believed she knew far more about Milly Theale than Milly knew herself, yet she had to keep her knowledge hidden and also use it carefully. Though she knew she wasn't naturally inclined towards deceit or complicated schemes, she found herself forced to be subtly manipulative because of a new situation, especially a new relationship. She realized that her education in the mysterious – she didn't know how else to describe it – had started the day she left New York with Mildred. She'd come from Boston specifically for that reason, having barely met the girl – or rather, having only known her briefly, because when Mrs. Stringham saw something, she saw everything – before accepting her offer. By doing so, she'd put herself in a situation she increasingly saw as enormously important, although also, because of its significance, probably quite safe. The previous winter in Boston, the young woman we're interested in had immediately and quietly appealed to her, planting in her mind the hopeful idea of offering some help, some devotion. Mrs. Stringham's life had often been filled with such hopes – secret dreams that had briefly flourished in her limited life, rarely daring to look outside her rather dull existence. But this particular idea – the fantasy of a connection with the extraordinary young woman from New York – had been bolder: it had immediately positioned itself at the best vantage point it could find and could be said to have stayed there until, just a few months later, it had been surprised and delighted by a clear sign of confirmation.</i></p></div>

Milly Theale had Boston friends, such as they
were, and of recent making; and it was understood
that her visit to them—a visit that was not to be
meagre—had been undertaken, after a series of
bereavements, in the interest of the particular peace
that New York could not give. It was recognised,
liberally enough, that there were many things—perhaps
even too many—New York <i>could</i> give;
but this was felt to make no difference in the constant
fact that what you had most to do, under the
discipline of life, or of death, was really to feel your
situation as grave. Boston could help you to
that as nothing else could, and it had extended
to Milly, by every presumption, some such measure
of assistance. Mrs. Stringham was never to forget—for
the moment had not faded, nor the infinitely
fine vibration it set up in any degree ceased—her
own first sight of the striking apparition, then unheralded
and unexplained: the slim, constantly
pale, delicately haggard, anomalously, agreeably
angular young person, of not more than two-and-twenty
in spite of her marks, whose hair was some
how exceptionally red even for the real thing,
which it innocently confessed to being, and whose
clothes were remarkably black even for robes of
mourning, which was the meaning they expressed.
It was New York mourning, it was New York hair,
it was a New York history, confused as yet, but
multitudinous, of the loss of parents, brothers, sisters,
almost every human appendage, all on a scale
and with a sweep that had required the greater stage;
it was a New York legend of affecting, of romantic
isolation, and, beyond everything, it was by most accounts,
in respect to the mass of money so piled on
the girl's back, a set of New York possibilities. She
was alone, she was stricken, she was rich, and, in
particular, she was strange—a combination in itself
of a nature to engage Mrs. Stringham's attention.
But it was the strangeness that most determined
our good lady's sympathy, convinced as she was
that it was much greater than any one else—any
one but the sole Susan Stringham—supposed.
Susan privately settled it that Boston was not in
the least seeing her, was only occupied with her
seeing Boston, and that any assumed affinity between
the two characters was delusive and vain.
She was seeing her, and she had quite the deepest
moment of her life in now obeying the instinct to
conceal the vision. She couldn't explain it—no one
would understand. They would say clever Boston
things—Mrs. Stringham was from Burlington, Vermont,
which she boldly upheld as the real heart of
New England, Boston being "too far south"—but
they would only darken counsel.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly Theale had recently made some friends in Boston, and it was understood that her visit there—a visit that would be well-funded—was intended to find a sense of peace that New York couldn't offer, after a series of personal tragedies. It was generally accepted that New York had many opportunities, maybe even too many, but that didn't change the fact that the most important thing to do in life, or in the face of death, was to accept the seriousness of your situation. Boston could help with that like nothing else, and it was believed that Milly was receiving that kind of support. Mrs. Stringham would never forget the moment she first saw this striking figure, who was, at the time, unexpected and unexplained. It was the slim, consistently pale, subtly worn, and unusually attractive young woman, maybe no older than twenty-two despite her hardship, whose hair was an especially vibrant red, even for natural red hair, and whose clothing was exceptionally black, as in mourning clothes.</i></p><p><i>It was New York mourning, New York hair, a New York story, still unclear but filled with losses: parents, siblings, almost every close family member, all on a scale that demanded a larger setting. It was a New York legend of moving, romantic isolation, and, most importantly, according to most people, given the vast wealth the girl possessed, it was a collection of New York possibilities. She was alone, grieving, wealthy, and, in particular, peculiar – a combination that immediately captured Mrs. Stringham's attention. But it was the strangeness that most strongly drew our kind Mrs. Stringham's sympathy, as she was convinced that Milly's strangeness was much greater than anyone else—anyone but Susan Stringham herself—realized.</i></p><p><i>Privately, Susan decided that Boston wasn't really *seeing* Milly at all. Boston was just preoccupied with Milly observing it, and any perceived connection between the two was false and pointless. Susan, on the other hand, *was* seeing her, and had her most significant moment in her life by obeying the instinct to hide what she saw. She couldn't explain it – no one would understand. They would make their clever Boston remarks—Mrs. Stringham was from Burlington, Vermont, which she proudly claimed was the true heart of New England, Boston being "too far south"—but they would only cloud the truth.</i></p></div>

There could be no better proof, than this quick
intellectual split, of the impression made on our
friend, who shone, herself, she was well aware, with
but the reflected light of the admirable city. She
too had had her discipline, but it had not made
her striking; it had been prosaically usual, though
doubtless a decent dose; and had only made her
usual to match it—usual, that is, as Boston went.
She had lost first her husband, and then her mother,
with whom, on her husband's death, she had lived
again; so that now, childless, she was but more
sharply single than before. But she sat rather
coldly light, having, as she called it, enough to live
on—so far, that is, as she lived by bread alone:
how little indeed she was regularly content with that
diet appeared from the name she had made—Susan
Shepherd Stringham—as a contributor to the best
magazines. She wrote short stories, and she fondly
believed she had her "note," the art of showing
New England without showing it wholly in the
kitchen. She had not herself been brought up in
the kitchen; she knew others who had not; and to
speak for them had thus become with her a literary
mission. To <i>be</i> in truth literary had ever been her
dearest thought, the thought that kept her bright
little nippers perpetually in position. There were
masters, models, celebrities, mainly foreign, whom
she finely accounted so and in whose light she ingeniously
laboured; there were others whom, however
chattered about, she ranked with the inane, for
she was full of discrimination; but all categories
failed her—they ceased at least to signify—as soon
as she found herself in presence of the real thing,
the romantic life itself. That was what she saw in
Mildred—what positively made her hand a while
tremble too much for the pen. She had had, it
seemed to her, a revelation—such as even New
England refined and grammatical couldn't give;
and, all made up as she was of small neat memories
and ingenuities, little industries and ambitions,
mixed with something moral, personal, that was still
more intensely responsive, she felt her new friend
would have done her an ill turn if their friendship
shouldn't develop, and yet that nothing would be
left of anything else if it should. It was for the surrender
of everything else that she was, however,
quite prepared, and while she went about her usual
Boston business with her usual Boston probity she
was really all the while holding herself. She wore
her "handsome" felt hat, so Tyrolese, yet some
how, though feathered from the eagle's wing, so
truly domestic, with the same straightness and security;
she attached her fur boa with the same
honest precautions; she preserved her balance on
the ice-slopes with the same practised skill; she
opened, each evening, her "Transcript" with the
same interfusion of suspense and resignation; she
attended her almost daily concert with the same
expenditure of patience and the same economy of
passion; she flitted in and out of the Public Library
with the air of conscientiously returning or bravely
carrying off in her pocket the key of knowledge itself;
and finally—it was what she most did—she
watched the thin trickle of a fictive "love-interest"
through that somewhat serpentine channel, in the
magazines, which she mainly managed to keep clear
for it. But the real thing, all the while, was elsewhere;
the real thing had gone back to New York,
leaving behind it the two unsolved questions, quite
distinct, of why it <i>was</i> real, and whether she should
ever be so near it again.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The fact that our friend immediately changed her mind so quickly proved how impressed she was. She knew she was only shining because of the great city that she lived in. She had also followed a strict routine, but it hadn't made her stand out. Her life had been ordinary, but acceptable, which was typical for someone from Boston. She had lost her husband first, and then her mother, with whom she had lived after her husband died. Now, without children, she felt even more alone than before. However, she was financially comfortable, as she put it. She was living on enough money to survive on, but her true desires were evident from her pen name, Susan Shepherd Stringham, and her contributions to the most popular magazines. She wrote short stories, and she was convinced she had her own "voice," which involved portraying New England life without focusing solely on the kitchen. She herself hadn't grown up in a kitchen, and she knew others who hadn't either. So, she felt it was her literary duty to speak for them. To be a true writer had always been her greatest aspiration, and it kept her small, meticulous mind constantly focused. There were influential figures, role models, and celebrities, mostly from other countries, whom she greatly admired and whose techniques she studied. There were others, however, who she considered unimportant, regardless of their popularity, because she was good at recognizing quality. But all categories became meaningless as soon as she encountered something authentic, the exciting experience of real life. That was what she saw in Mildred—it was so powerful that her hand shook too much to write for a while. It seemed to her like a revelation, something that even the refined, intellectual world of New England couldn't provide. She was made up of neat memories, clever ideas, small projects, and ambitions. These were mixed with something moral and personal that was even more deeply felt. She thought her new friendship would be a disservice if it didn't develop, and yet she felt that everything else in her life would be lost if it did. She was ready to give up everything else, and while she went about her usual Boston routine with her usual Boston integrity, she was really just biding her time. She wore her "handsome" felt hat, which looked Tyrolean, yet somehow, despite being decorated with feathers, it seemed incredibly practical. She always tied her fur boa with the same caution. She kept her balance on the icy sidewalks with the same practiced skill. She opened her newspaper each evening with the same mixture of anticipation and acceptance. She attended her almost daily concert with the same display of patience and the same restraint of emotion. She went in and out of the public library as if she were conscientiously returning or bravely carrying off the key to knowledge itself. Finally—and this was what she did most—she watched the thin flow of fictional romance through the somewhat winding path of the magazines, which she mostly managed to keep open for it. But the real experience, meanwhile, was somewhere else. The real thing had returned to New York, leaving behind two unanswered questions, completely separate, about why it was genuine, and whether she would ever experience it again.</i></p></div>

<p>
For the figure to which these questions attached
themselves she had found a convenient description—she
thought of it for herself, always, as that of a
girl with a background. The great reality was in
the fact that, very soon, after but two or three
meetings, the girl with the background, the girl
with the crown of old gold and the mourning that
was not as the mourning of Boston, but at once
more rebellious in its gloom and more frivolous in
its frills, had told her she had never seen any one
like her. They had met thus as opposed curiosities,
and that simple remark of Milly's—if simple it was—became
the most important thing that had ever
happened to her; it deprived the love-interest, for
the time, of actuality and even of pertinence; it
moved her first, in short, in a high degree, to gratitude,
and then to no small compassion. Yet in respect
to this relation at least it was what did prove
the key of knowledge; it lighted up as nothing else
could do the poor young woman's history. That
the potential heiress of all the ages should never
have seen any one like a mere typical subscriber,
after all, to the "Transcript" was a truth that—in
especial as announced with modesty, with humility,
with regret—described a situation. It laid upon
the elder woman, as to the void to be filled, a
weight of responsibility; but in particular it led her
to ask whom poor Mildred <i>had</i> then seen, and what
range of contacts it had taken to produce such
queer surprises. That was really the inquiry that
had ended by clearing the air: the key of knowledge
was felt to click in the lock from the moment
it flashed upon Mrs. Stringham that her friend had
been starved for culture. Culture was what she
herself represented for her, and it was living up to
that principle that would surely prove the great
business. She knew, the clever lady, what the
principle itself represented, and the limits of her
own store; and a certain alarm would have grown
upon her if something else hadn't grown faster.

The truly significant thing was that, very quickly, after only a few meetings, this girl, the one with the crown of antique gold and mourning that was different from the usual Boston kind, more rebellious in its sadness and more extravagant in its ornamentation, had told her she’d never met anyone like her. They’d begun their relationship as opposing oddities, and that simple comment from Milly – if simple it was – became the most important thing that had ever happened to her. It made the romantic interest, for the moment, seem unimportant, even irrelevant. It first moved her deeply to gratitude, and then to a good deal of sympathy. Yet, at least concerning this relationship, it actually unlocked understanding; it illuminated the young woman's past in a way nothing else could. The fact that this potential heiress, from a lineage stretching back through the ages, had never seen anyone like a typical "Transcript" reader was a truth that, particularly when expressed with modesty, humility, and regret, defined a situation. It placed a burden of responsibility on the older woman, concerning the emptiness she could fill; but, more specifically, it led her to wonder whom poor Mildred *had* seen, and what kind of encounters had caused such surprising opinions.

This was, fortunately for her—and we give it in her
own words—the sense of a harrowing pathos.
That, primarily, was what appealed to her, what
seemed to open the door of romance for her still
wider than any, than a still more reckless, connection
with the "picture-papers." For such was
essentially the point: it was rich, romantic, abysmal,
to have, as was evident, thousands and thousands a
year, to have youth and intelligence and if not
beauty, at least, in equal measure, a high, dim,
charming, ambiguous oddity, which was even better,
and then on top of all to enjoy boundless freedom,
the freedom of the wind in the desert—it was
unspeakably touching to be so equipped and yet to
have been reduced by fortune to little humble-minded
mistakes.

It brought our friend's imagination back again
to New York, where aberrations were so possible
in the intellectual sphere, and it in fact caused a
visit she presently paid there to overflow with interest.
As Milly had beautifully invited her, so she
would hold out if she could against the strain of
so much confidence in her mind; and the remarkable
thing was that even at the end of three weeks
she <i>had</i> held out. But by this time her mind had
grown comparatively bold and free; it was dealing
with new quantities, a different proportion altogether—and
that had made for refreshment: she
had accordingly gone home in convenient possession
of her subject. New York was vast, New York
was startling, with strange histories, with wild cosmopolite
backward generations that accounted for
anything; and to have got nearer the luxuriant
tribe of which the rare creature was the final flower,
the immense, extravagant, unregulated cluster, with
free-living ancestors, handsome dead cousins, lurid
uncles, beautiful vanished aunts, persons all busts
and curls, preserved, though so exposed, in the
marble of famous French chisels—all this, to say
nothing of the effect of closer growths of the stem,
was to have had one's small world-space both
crowded and enlarged. Our couple had at all
events effected an exchange; the elder friend had
been as consciously intellectual as possible, and the
younger, abounding in personal revelation, had
been as unconsciously distinguished. This was
poetry—it was also history—Mrs. Stringham
thought, to a finer tune even than Maeterlink and
Pater, than Marbot and Gregorovius. She appointed
occasions for the reading of these authors
with her hostess, rather perhaps than actually
achieved great spans; but what they managed and
what they missed speedily sank for her into the dim
depths of the merely relative, so quickly, so strongly
had she clutched her central clue. All her scruples
and hesitations, all her anxious enthusiasms, had reduced
themselves to a single alarm—the fear that
she really might act on her companion clumsily and
coarsely. She was positively afraid of what she
might do to her, and to avoid that, to avoid it with
piety and passion, to do, rather, nothing at all, to
leave her untouched because no touch one could
apply, however light, however just, however earnest
and anxious, would be half good enough, would be
anything but an ugly smutch upon perfection—this
now imposed itself as a consistent, an inspiring
thought.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It brought our friend's imagination back to New York. In New York, anything felt possible in the world of ideas. This inspired a visit she took there, which turned out to be incredibly interesting. Milly had gracefully invited her, and she had tried to resist the pressure of so much trust placed in her. The surprising thing was that she succeeded for three weeks. But by then, her mind had become more confident and open. It was dealing with new concepts and a completely different perspective, which was refreshing. She ultimately returned home, ready to understand her subject. New York was huge and surprising, filled with strange stories and wild, diverse generations that could explain anything. To get closer to the fascinating group of which this rare person was the ultimate representative—the huge, unrestrained collection with free-spirited ancestors, attractive deceased relatives, scandalous uncles, beautiful deceased aunts, people who were like statues preserved in famous French sculptures—all this, not to mention the impact of more intimate connections, had both filled and expanded her own world.</i></p><p><i>In any case, the two friends had made an exchange: the older friend had been as intellectual and thoughtful as possible, while the younger friend, overflowing with personal revelations, was naturally remarkable. This was poetry, and it was also history—Mrs. Stringham thought, even more beautifully than Maeterlink and Pater, than Marbot and Gregorovius. She planned to read these authors with her hostess, though perhaps she didn't read for very long. But what they did manage to read, and what they missed, quickly became insignificant to her, lost in the realm of relativity. She had grasped her central understanding so quickly and firmly. All her doubts, hesitations, and enthusiastic worries had narrowed down to one fear: that she might act awkwardly and clumsily towards her companion. She was genuinely afraid of what she might do to her. To avoid that, to avoid it with deep respect and passion, to do nothing at all, to leave her untouched because no action, however gentle, however fair, however sincere and worried, would be good enough, would be anything but a blemish on perfection—this had become her driving and inspiring thought.</i></p></div>

Less than a month after the event that had so
determined Mrs. Stringham's attitude—close upon
the heels, that is, of her return from New York—she
was reached by a proposal that brought up for
her the kind of question her delicacy might have
to contend with. Would she start for Europe with
her young friend at the earliest possible date, and
should she be willing to do so without making conditions?
The inquiry was launched by wire; explanations,
in sufficiency, were promised; extreme
urgency was suggested, and a general surrender
invited. It was to the honour of her sincerity that
she made the surrender on the spot, though it was
not perhaps altogether to that of her logic. She
had wanted, very consciously, from the first, to give
something up for her new acquaintance, but she
had now no doubt that she was practically giving
up all. What settled this was the fulness of a particular
impression, the impression that had throughout
more and more supported her and which she
would have uttered so far as she might by saying
that the charm of the creature was positively in the
creature's greatness. She would have been content
so to leave it; unless indeed she had said, more
familiarly, that Mildred was the biggest impression
of her life. That was at all events the biggest account
of her, and none but a big, clearly, would do.
Her situation, as such things were called, was on
the grand scale; but it still was not that. It was
her nature, once for all—a nature that reminded
Mrs. Stringham of the term always used in the newspapers
about the great new steamers, the inordinate
number of "feet of water" they drew; so
that if, in your little boat, you had chosen to hover
and approach, you had but yourself to thank, when
once motion was started, for the way the draught
pulled you. Milly drew the feet of water, and odd
though it might seem that a lonely girl, who was
not robust and who hated sound and show, should
stir the stream like a leviathan, her companion
floated off with the sense of rocking violently at
her side. More than prepared, however, for that
excitement, Mrs. Stringham mainly failed of ease
in respect to her own consistency. To attach herself
for an indefinite time seemed a roundabout
way of holding her hands off. If she wished to be
sure of neither touching nor smutching, the
straighter plan would doubtless have been not to
keep her friend within reach. This in fact she fully
recognised, and with it the degree to which she
desired that the girl should lead her life, a life certain
to be so much finer than that of anybody else.
The difficulty, however, by good fortune, cleared
away as soon as she had further recognised, as she
was speedily able to do, that she, Susan Shepherd—the
name with which Milly for the most part
amused herself—was <i>not</i> anybody else. She had
renounced that character; she had now no life to
lead; and she honestly believed that she was thus
supremely equipped for leading Milly's own. No
other person whatever, she was sure, had to an
equal degree this qualification, and it was really to
assert it that she fondly embarked.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Less than a month after the incident that had profoundly shaped Mrs. Stringham's feelings—shortly after her return from New York—she received a proposition that forced her to confront a question her own sense of propriety might struggle with. Would she depart for Europe with her young friend as soon as possible, and would she be willing to do so without any reservations or demands?</i></p><p><i>The inquiry arrived by telegram; explanations would follow, they promised; the situation was described as extremely urgent, and a complete, unconditional agreement was requested. To her credit, she agreed immediately, though perhaps not entirely based on rational thought. From the beginning, she had consciously wanted to sacrifice something for her new friend, but now she felt she was essentially giving up everything. This decision was cemented by a powerful, recurring feeling, an impression that had increasingly sustained her. She would have explained it by saying that her friend's charm stemmed from her inherent greatness. That would have sufficed, unless she had phrased it more casually, by saying Mildred was the most significant presence in her life. That was, at any rate, the most accurate description, and anything less would simply not do.</i></p><p><i>Her role in this situation, as it was understood, was on a large scale; but that wasn’t quite it. It was her very nature, her fundamental being—a nature that reminded Mrs. Stringham of the phrase often used in the newspapers about the huge new ships, the enormous "feet of water" they drew; so that, if you had decided to approach her in a small boat, you only had yourself to blame, once the ship began to move, for the way the current pulled you along. Milly drew the "feet of water," and, strange as it seemed that a solitary girl, not physically strong and averse to noise and display, should create such a powerful current, her companion felt herself rocking violently alongside.</i></p><p><i>Though she was more than ready for this kind of upheaval, Mrs. Stringham was primarily uneasy about maintaining her own principles. Committing herself for an unspecified period seemed a convoluted way of maintaining distance. If she wanted to ensure she neither interfered nor caused problems, the more straightforward solution would undoubtedly have been to avoid staying close to her friend. In fact, she fully acknowledged this, along with the degree to which she wanted the girl to live her life—a life destined to be far more extraordinary than anyone else's.</i></p><p><i>However, thankfully, the problem resolved itself as soon as she further realized, which she quickly did, that she, Susan Shepherd—the name Milly often playfully used for her—was not just anyone. She had relinquished that role; she now had no life of her own to live; and she genuinely believed that she was, in this way, ideally suited to guide Milly's. She was certain that no one else possessed this qualification to the same degree, and it was primarily to establish this fact that she enthusiastically embarked on this journey.</i></p></div>

Many things, though not in many weeks, had
come and gone since then, and one of the best of
them, doubtless, had been the voyage itself, by
the happy southern course, to the succession of
Mediterranean ports, with the dazzled wind-up at
Naples. Two or three others had preceded this;
incidents, indeed rather lively marks, of their last
fortnight at home, and one of which had determined
on Mrs. Stringham's part a rush to New York, forty-eight
breathless hours there, previous to her final
rally. But the great sustained sea-light had drunk
up the rest of the picture, so that for many days
other questions and other possibilities sounded with
as little effect as a trio of penny whistles might
sound in a Wagner overture. It was the Wagner
overture that practically prevailed, up through Italy,
where Milly had already been, still further up and
across the Alps, which were also partly known to
Mrs. Stringham; only perhaps "taken" to a time
not wholly congruous, hurried in fact on account
of the girl's high restlessness. She had been expected,
she had frankly promised, to be restless—that
was partly why she was "great"—or was a
consequence, at any rate, if not a cause; yet she
had not perhaps altogether announced herself as
straining so hard at the cord. It was familiar, it
was beautiful to Mrs. Stringham that she had arrears
to make up, the chances that had lapsed for
her through the wanton ways of forefathers fond of
Paris, but not of its higher sides, and fond almost
of nothing else; but the vagueness, the openness,
the eagerness without point and the interest without
pause—all a part of the charm of her oddity as
at first presented—had become more striking in
proportion as they triumphed over movement and
change. She had arts and idiosyncrasies of which
no great account could have been given, but which
were a daily grace if you lived with them; such as
the art of being almost tragically impatient and yet
making it as light as air; of being inexplicably sad
and yet making it as clear as noon; of being unmistakably
gay, and yet making it as soft as dusk.
Mrs. Stringham by this time understood everything,
was more than ever confirmed in wonder and
admiration, in her view that it was life enough simply
to feel her companion's feelings; but there were
special keys she had not yet added to her bunch,
impressions that, of a sudden, were apt to affect her
as new.

They’d taken the pleasant southern route, visiting a series of Mediterranean ports, culminating in the dazzling experience in Naples. A couple of other significant events had occurred before this: lively memories of their last two weeks at home. One of these events caused Mrs. Stringham to rush to New York for forty-eight frantic hours before her final travel plans solidified. However, the expansive, sustained beauty of the sea had overshadowed everything else. For a long time, other concerns and possibilities seemed insignificant, like the sound of penny whistles against a Wagner overture. It was, in a way, like the Wagner overture that prevailed, particularly through Italy, where Milly had already been. She had also traveled further into the Alps, which Mrs. Stringham was also familiar with, although maybe not at a time that suited the present, as the travels were hurried due to the girl's high level of anxiety. It was expected and frankly promised that she would be restless—that was partly why she was considered "great"—or, at the very least, a consequence, if not the cause. Yet she hadn't completely revealed how much she was struggling. It was familiar and lovely to Mrs. Stringham that there were experiences to be had, opportunities that had been missed because of her ancestors' love for Paris and not its more sophisticated aspects, or their passion for anything else. But the vagueness, the openness, the fervent but directionless eagerness, and the continuous interest—all aspects of the charm of her unusual nature, as initially presented—had become more noticeable as they withstood movement and change. She possessed skills and unique traits that were hard to describe but were a daily delight if you lived with her. She had the art of being almost tragically impatient yet making it seem lighthearted. She had the skill of being inexplicably sad but making it as clear as daylight. She had the ability to be undeniably cheerful but making it as gentle as twilight. By this time, Mrs. Stringham understood everything, and her admiration and amazement were stronger than ever. She thought it was enough to experience her companion's feelings, but there were specific understandings she hadn't yet grasped, impressions that suddenly seemed new to her.</i></p></div>

This particular day on the great Swiss road had
been, for some reason, full of them, and they referred
themselves, provisionally, to some deeper
depth than she had touched—though into two or
three such depths, it must be added, she had peeped
long enough to find herself suddenly draw back. It
was not Milly's unpacified state, in short, that now
troubled her—though certainly, as Europe was the
great American sedative, the failure was to some
extent to be noted: it was the suspected presence
of something behind it—which, however, could
scarcely have taken its place there since their departure.
What any fresh motive of unrest could
suddenly have sprung from was, in short, not to be
divined. It was but half an explanation to say that
excitement, for each of them, had naturally dropped,
and that what they had left behind, or tried to—the
great serious facts of life, as Mrs. Stringham liked
to call them—was once more coming into sight
as objects loom through smoke when smoke begins
to clear; for these were general appearances from
which the girl's own aspect, her really larger vagueness,
seemed rather to disconnect itself. The nearest
approach to a personal anxiety indulged in as
yet by the elder lady was on her taking occasion to
wonder if what she had more than anything else
got hold of mightn't be one of the finer, one of the
finest, one of the rarest—as she called it so that she
might call it nothing worse—cases of American
intensity. She had just had a moment of alarm—asked
herself if her young friend were merely going
to treat her to some complicated drama of nerves. At
the end of a week, however, with their further progress,
her young friend had effectively answered the
question and given her the impression, indistinct indeed
as yet, of something that had a reality compared
with which the nervous explanation would have
been coarse. Mrs. Stringham found herself from
that hour, in other words, in presence of an explanation
that remained a muffled and intangible
form, but that, assuredly, should it take on sharpness,
would explain everything and more than
everything, would become instantly the light in
which Milly was to be read.

In short, it wasn't Milly's unsettled mood that was bothering her now—though, certainly, since Europe was supposed to calm Americans, that failure was somewhat noticeable. It was the suspicion that something was lurking behind it all, something that couldn't possibly have appeared since they left home. What any new source of anxiety could have suddenly emerged from was, simply, a mystery. It was only a partial explanation to say that the excitement had naturally faded for both of them, and that the things they'd left behind, or tried to—the big serious issues of life, as Mrs. Stringham liked to call them—were coming back into view like objects emerging from smoke as it clears. These were general observations, and the girl's own condition, her broader sense of unease, seemed rather separate from them. The closest the older woman had come to a personal worry was when she wondered if what she'd discovered might be one of the more subtle, one of the finest, one of the rarest—she used that language so she wouldn't have to use anything worse—cases of intense American behavior. She'd briefly been concerned, wondering if her young friend was just going to put on some complicated act based on her nerves. After a week, however, as they continued traveling, her young friend had effectively answered that question and given her the still-vague impression of something truly real, something compared to which the nervous explanation seemed crude. From that point on, in other words, Mrs. Stringham found herself facing an explanation that remained vague and undefined, but which, if it ever sharpened, would undoubtedly explain everything and more, and would immediately become the key to understanding Milly.</i></p></div>

Such a matter as this may at all events speak of
the style in which our young woman could affect
those who were near her, may testify to the sort of
interest she could inspire. She worked—and seemingly
quite without design—upon the sympathy,
the curiosity, the fancy of her associates, and we
shall really ourselves scarce otherwise come closer
to her than by feeling their impression and sharing,
if need be, their confusion. She reduced them, Mrs.
Stringham would have said, reduced them to a consenting
bewilderment; which was precisely, for that
good lady, on a last analysis, what was most in
harmony with her greatness. She exceeded, escaped
measure, was surprising only because <i>they</i>
were so far from great. Thus it was that on this
wondrous day on the Brünig the spell of watching
her had grown more than ever irresistible; a proof
of what—or of a part of what—Mrs. Stringham had,
with all the rest, been reduced to. She had almost
the sense of tracking her young friend as if at a
given moment to pounce. She knew she shouldn't
pounce, she hadn't come out to pounce; yet she
felt her attention secretive, all the same, and her
observation scientific. She struck herself as hovering
like a spy, applying tests, laying traps, concealing
signs. This would last, however, only till she
should fairly know what was the matter; and to
watch was, after all, meanwhile, a way of clinging
to the girl, not less than an occupation, a satisfaction
in itself. The pleasure of watching, moreover,
if a reason were needed, came from a sense
of her beauty. Her beauty hadn't at all originally
seemed a part of the situation, and Mrs. Stringham
had, even in the first flush of friendship, not named
it, grossly, to any one; having seen early that, for
stupid people—and who, she sometimes secretly
asked herself, wasn't stupid?—it would take a great
deal of explaining. She had learned not to mention
it till it was mentioned first—which occasionally
happened, but not too often; and then she was
there in force. Then she both warmed to the perception
that met her own perception, and disputed
it, suspiciously, as to special items; while, in general,
she had learned to refine even to the point of
herself employing the word that most people employed.
She employed it to pretend that she was
also stupid and so have done with the matter; spoke
of her friend as plain, as ugly even, in a case of
especially dense insistence; but as, in appearance,
so "awfully full of things." This was her own
way of describing a face that, thanks, doubtless, to
rather too much forehead, too much nose and too
much mouth, together with too little mere conventional
colour and conventional line, was expressive,
irregular, exquisite, both for speech and for silence.
When Milly smiled it was a public event—when she
didn't it was a chapter of history. They had
stopped, on the Brünig, for luncheon, and there
had come up for them under the charm of the place
the question of a longer stay.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>This whole thing gives us a sense of how this young woman affected the people around her, and the kind of interest she could spark. She seemed to effortlessly influence the sympathy, curiosity, and imagination of her friends. Honestly, the best way for us to understand her is to feel their reactions and, if necessary, share in their confusion. Mrs. Stringham would say she reduced them, reduced them to a state of willing bewilderment. And for that good woman, that was the ultimate indication of this woman's greatness. She was exceptional, defied expectations, and was surprising simply because they weren't particularly remarkable themselves. So, on this amazing day on the Brünig, the pull of watching her was stronger than ever. It proved—or at least partially proved—what Mrs. Stringham, along with everyone else, had been reduced to. She almost felt like she was secretly following her young friend, ready to pounce. She knew she shouldn't, she hadn't come out looking to pounce, but her attention felt hidden, almost scientific. She felt like a spy, setting up tests, laying traps, and hiding clues. However, that would only last until she figured out what was really going on. But for now, watching her was a way of staying connected to the girl, and it was also something to do and enjoy. The pleasure of watching her, if a reason were needed, was rooted in her beauty. Her beauty hadn't initially seemed to be a key element, and Mrs. Stringham, even early in their friendship, hadn't explicitly mentioned it to anyone. She knew early on that for some people—and secretly, she sometimes wondered, who *wasn't* stupid?—it would take a lot of explanation. She learned not to bring it up until someone else did—which happened occasionally, but not often. Then she would jump in. She would embrace the other person's observation, but also argue with them about specific aspects of it. Generally, she had learned to be subtle enough to use the same word most people used. She would use it to pretend she was also dense and to get the topic over with. She’d describe her friend as plain, even ugly, when someone was being particularly insistent. But in reality, she said the woman was "awfully full of things." That was her way of describing a face that, perhaps because of a rather prominent forehead, nose, and mouth, along with a lack of conventional color and features, was expressive, unusual, and exquisite, both in moments of speech and silence. When Milly smiled, it was a major event. When she didn't, it was a historical moment.

Mrs. Stringham was now on the ground of
thrilled recognitions, small sharp echoes of a past
which she kept in a well-thumbed case, but which,
on pressure of a spring and exposure to the air,
still showed itself ticking as hard as an honest old
watch. The embalmed "Europe" of her younger
time had partly stood for three years of Switzerland,
a term of continuous school at Vevey, with rewards
of merit in the form of silver medals tied by blue
ribbons and mild mountain-passes attacked with
alpenstocks. It was the good girls who, in the holidays,
were taken highest, and our friend could now
judge, from what she supposed her familiarity with
the minor peaks, that she had been one of the best.
These reminiscences, sacred to-day because prepared
in the hushed chambers of the past, had been
part of the general train laid for the pair of sisters,
daughters early fatherless, by their brave Vermont
mother, who struck her at present as having apparently,
almost like Columbus, worked out, all unassisted,
a conception of the other side of the globe.
She had focussed Vevey, by the light of nature, and
with extraordinary completeness, at Burlington;
after which she had embarked, sailed, landed, explored
and, above all, made good her presence.
She had given her daughters the five years in
Switzerland and Germany that were to leave them
ever afterwards a standard of comparison for all
cycles of Cathay, and to stamp the younger in especial—Susan
was the younger—with a character
that, as Mrs. Stringham had often had occasion,
through life, to say to herself, made all the difference.
It made all the difference for Mrs. Stringham,
over and over again and in the most remote
connections, that, thanks to her parent's lonely,
thrifty, hardy faith, she was a woman of the world.
There were plenty of women who were all sorts of
things that she wasn't, but who, on the other hand,
were not that, and who didn't know <i>she</i> was (which
she liked—it relegated them still further) and didn't
know, either, how it enabled her to judge them.
She had never seen herself so much in this light as
during the actual phase of her associated, if slightly
undirected, pilgrimage; and the consciousness gave
perhaps to her plea for a pause more intensity than
she knew. The irrecoverable days had come back
to her from far off; they were part of the sense of
the cool upper air and of everything else that hung
like an indestructible scent to the torn garment of
youth—the taste of honey and the luxury of milk,
the sound of cattle-bells and the rush of streams, the
fragrance of trodden balms and the dizziness of deep
gorges.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Mrs. Stringham was now reminiscing, reliving moments from her past that she kept carefully guarded. These memories, though tucked away, were still vibrant and active, like a well-maintained antique watch. Her "Europe" of youth primarily consisted of three years in Switzerland, including continuous schooling in Vevey, where she earned silver medals tied with blue ribbons and hiked through mountain passes with alpenstocks. She realized now that, based on her familiarity with the smaller mountains, she must have been a very successful student, as the best girls got to go on the most impressive hikes during holidays.</i></p><p><i>These memories, precious because they were born in the past, were part of the foundation laid for her and her sister by their courageous Vermont-born mother. Mrs. Stringham now saw her mother as someone who, like Columbus, had independently conceived of and planned their journey to Europe.

Milly clearly felt these things too, but they affected
her companion at moments—that was quite
the way Mrs. Stringham would have expressed it—as
the princess in a conventional tragedy might
have affected the confidant if a personal emotion
had ever been permitted to the latter. That a princess
could only be a princess was a truth with which,
essentially, a confidant, however responsive, had to
live. Mrs. Stringham was a woman of the world,
but Milly Theale was a princess, the only one she
had yet had to deal with, and this in its way, too,
made all the difference. It was a perfectly definite
doom for the wearer—it was for every one else
a perfectly palpable quality. It might have been,
possibly, with its involved loneliness and other mysteries,
the weight under which she fancied her companion's
admirable head occasionally, and ever so
submissively, bowed. Milly had quite assented at
luncheon to their staying over, and had left her to
look at rooms, settle questions, arrange about their
keeping on their carriage and horses; cares that
had now moreover fallen to Mrs. Stringham as a
matter of course and that yet for some reason, on
this occasion particularly, brought home to her—all
agreeably, richly, almost grandly—what it was to
live with the great. Her young friend had, in a
sublime degree, a sense closed to the general question
of difficulty, which she got rid of, furthermore,
not in the least as one had seen many charming
persons do, by merely passing it on to others. She
kept it completely at a distance: it never entered
the circle; the most plaintive confidant couldn't
have dragged it in; and to tread the path of a confidant
was accordingly to live exempt. Service was
in other words so easy to render that the whole
thing was like court life without the hardships. It
came back of course to the question of money, and
our observant lady had by this time repeatedly reflected
that if one were talking of the "difference,"
it was just this, this incomparably and nothing else,
that when all was said and done most made it. A
less vulgarly, a less obviously purchasing or parading
person she couldn't have imagined; but it was,
all the same, the truth of truths that the girl couldn't
get away from her wealth. She might leave her
conscientious companion as freely alone with it as
possible and never ask a question, scarce even tolerate
a reference; but it was in the fine folds of the
helplessly expensive little black frock that she drew
over the grass as she now strolled vaguely off; it
was in the curious and splendid coils of hair,
"done" with no eye whatever to the <i>mode du jour,</i>
that peeped from under the corresponding indifference
of her hat, the merely personal tradition that
suggested a sort of noble inelegance; it lurked between
the leaves of the uncut but antiquated Tauchnitz
volume of which, before going out, she had
mechanically possessed herself. She couldn't dress
it away, nor walk it away, nor read it away, nor
think it away; she could neither smile it away in
any dreamy absence nor blow it away in any softened
sigh. She couldn't have lost it if she had
tried—that was what it was to be really rich. It
had to be <i>the</i> thing you were. When at the end of
an hour she had not returned to the house Mrs.
Stringham, though the bright afternoon was yet
young, took, with precautions, the same direction,
went to join her in case of her caring for a walk.
But the purpose of joining her was in truth less distinct
than that of a due regard for a possibly preferred
detachment: so that, once more, the good
lady proceeded with a quietness that made her
slightly "underhand" even in her own eyes. She
couldn't help that, however, and she didn't care,
sure as she was that what she really wanted was not
to overstep, but to stop in time. It was to be able
to stop in time that she went softly, but she had
on this occasion further to go than ever yet, for
she followed in vain, and at last with some anxiety,
the footpath she believed Milly to have taken. It
wound up a hillside and into the higher Alpine
meadows in which, all these last days, they had so
often wanted, as they passed above or below, to
stray; and then it obscured itself in a wood, but
always going up, up, and with a small cluster of
brown old high-perched chalets evidently for its
goal. Mrs. Stringham reached in due course the
chalets, and there received from a bewildered old
woman, a very fearful person to behold, an indication
that sufficiently guided her. The young lady
had been seen not long before passing further on,
over a crest and to a place where the way would
drop again, as our unappeased inquirer found it, in
fact, a quarter of an hour later, markedly and almost
alarmingly to do. It led somewhere, yet apparently
quite into space, for the great side of the mountain
appeared, from where she pulled up, to fall away
altogether, though probably but to some issue below
and out of sight. Her uncertainty moreover
was brief, for she next became aware of the presence
on a fragment of rock, twenty yards off, of the
Tauchnitz volume that the girl had brought out,
and that therefore pointed to her shortly previous
passage. She had rid herself of the book, which
was an encumbrance, and meant of course to pick
it up on her return; but as she hadn't yet picked it
up what on earth had become of her? Mrs. Stringham,
I hasten to add, was within a few moments to
see; but it was quite an accident that she had not,
before they were over, betrayed by her deeper agitation
the fact of her own nearness.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly clearly felt things, but they affected her companion at certain moments—that’s how Mrs. Stringham would have phrased it—the same way a princess in a classic tragedy might affect her confidante if the latter were allowed to express personal emotions. The simple fact was that a princess could only be a princess, and a confidante, however sympathetic, had to accept that. Mrs. Stringham was worldly, but Milly Theale was a princess, the only one she’d ever dealt with. That made all the difference too. It was a definite fate for the princess, and for everyone else, a clear characteristic. Mrs. Stringham imagined it was the burden that made her companion’s admirable head bow occasionally, always respectfully. Milly had agreed to stay over for lunch and had left Mrs. Stringham to look at rooms, sort out arrangements, and take care of keeping their carriage and horses. These responsibilities had naturally fallen to Mrs. Stringham, and yet, on this occasion, they brought home to her—pleasantly, richly, almost grandly—what it meant to live with the wealthy. Her young friend had a remarkable ability to avoid difficulty, and she didn’t pass it on to others, as many charming people do. She kept it completely separate, never letting it interfere. The most complaining confidante couldn’t have dragged it into their conversation. Thus, being a confidante meant living an easy life. In other words, serving was so effortless that it felt like court life without the hardship. It came back to the question of money, and Mrs. Stringham had repeatedly realized that if there was a "difference," it was exactly this, and nothing else, that made the biggest impact. She couldn’t imagine a less vulgar or showy person, but the truth was that the girl couldn’t escape her wealth. She might leave her conscientious companion alone with it and never ask a question, hardly even acknowledge it, but it was in the elegant folds of the expensive black dress she wore while strolling across the grass; it was in the curious and beautiful hairstyle, styled without regard to current fashion, peeking from under the similarly casual hat, the personal tradition suggesting a sort of noble lack of elegance; it lingered between the pages of the uncut, antiquated Tauchnitz book she had picked up before going out. She couldn't dress it away, or walk it away, or read it away, or think it away. She couldn’t smile it away in absent-mindedness or blow it away in a soft sigh. She couldn't have lost it if she tried—that's what being truly rich meant. It was just who she was. When Milly hadn't returned after an hour, Mrs. Stringham, although it was still early afternoon, took precautions and followed the same path, intending to join her in case she wanted company on her walk. But the intention to join her was less clear than a desire to respect a possibly preferred solitude, so the good lady proceeded quietly, which made her feel slightly "underhanded," even to herself. She couldn't help it, and she didn’t care, because she was sure that she really wanted not to overstep her boundaries, but to stop in time. She went softly to be able to stop in time, but on this occasion she needed to go further than ever before, as she searched in vain for Milly, following the footpath she believed her to have taken. It wound up a hillside and into the high Alpine meadows where they had often wanted to wander, then disappeared into a wood, always going up, up, and toward a small group of brown, old, high-perched chalets. Mrs. Stringham eventually reached the chalets and was guided by a bewildered old woman, a very frightening sight. The young lady had recently been seen passing further on, over a crest, to a place where the path dropped down again, as Mrs. Stringham realized a quarter of an hour later. The path led somewhere, but seemingly nowhere, because the side of the mountain appeared to fall away altogether, although likely to some point below and out of sight. Her uncertainty was brief, because she then noticed the Tauchnitz book on a rock twenty yards away, which meant Milly had recently passed that way. She had gotten rid of the book, which was a burden, and meant to pick it up on her return. But since she hadn't yet picked it up, what had happened to her? Mrs. Stringham was about to find out, but by chance, she hadn't revealed her inner turmoil before.</i></p></div>

<p>
The whole place, with the descent of the path
and as a sequel to a sharp turn that was masked by
rocks and shrubs, appeared to fall precipitously and
to become a "view" pure and simple, a view of
great extent and beauty, but thrown forward and
vertiginous. Milly, with the promise of it from just
above, had gone straight down to it, not stopping
till it was all before her; and here, on what struck
her friend as the dizzy edge of it, she was seated
at her ease. The path somehow took care of itself
and its final business, but the girl's seat was a slab
of rock at the end of a short promontory or excrescence
that merely pointed off to the right into
gulfs of air and that was so placed by good fortune,
if not by the worst, as to be at last completely
visible. For Mrs. Stringham stifled a cry on taking
in what she believed to be the danger of such a
perch for a mere maiden; her liability to slip, to
slide, to leap, to be precipitated by a single false
movement, by a turn of the head—how could one
tell? into whatever was beneath. A thousand
thoughts, for the minute, roared in the poor lady's
ears, but without reaching, as happened, Milly's. It
was a commotion that left our observer intensely
still and holding her breath. What had first been
offered her was the possibility of a latent intention—however
wild the idea—in such a posture; of
some betrayed accordance of Milly's caprice with
a horrible hidden obsession. But since Mrs. Stringham
stood as motionless as if a sound, a syllable,
must have produced the start that would be fatal,
so even the lapse of a few seconds had a partly
reassuring effect. It gave her time to receive the
impression which, when she some minutes later
softly retraced her steps, was to be the sharpest she
carried away. This was the impression that if the
girl was deeply and recklessly meditating there, she
was not meditating a jump; she was on the contrary,
as she sat, much more in a state of uplifted
and unlimited possession that had nothing to gain
from violence. She was looking down on the kingdoms
of the earth, and though indeed that of itself
might well go to the brain, it wouldn't be with a
view of renouncing them. Was she choosing
among them, or did she want them all? This question,
before Mrs. Stringham had decided what to
do, made others vain; in accordance with which she
saw, or believed she did, that if it might be dangerous
to call out, to sound in any way a surprise, it
would probably be safe enough to withdraw as she
had come. She watched a while longer, she held
her breath, and she never knew afterwards what
time had elapsed.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The entire area, with the path sloping downwards and following a sharp bend hidden by rocks and bushes, seemed to plunge downwards dramatically, becoming purely a "view." It was a vast and beautiful panorama, but also overwhelming and dizzying. Milly, having been shown the promise of it from above, had immediately descended to it, not stopping until she was completely immersed in it. Now, perched on what seemed to her friend like the precarious edge of it, she sat comfortably. The path seemed to manage itself and its final descent, but the girl's seat was a rock slab at the end of a short, protruding ledge that jutted out to the right, into open air. Luckily, or perhaps unfortunately, the ledge was completely visible. Mrs. Stringham suppressed a gasp, terrified by what she perceived as the danger of such a position for a young woman. The risk of slipping, sliding, jumping, or being thrown off by a single wrong move, a turn of the head—who could say?—into whatever lay below. A thousand panicked thoughts raced through the poor woman's mind for a moment, but none of them reached Milly. It was a turmoil that left our observer intensely still and holding her breath. The initial thought that came to her was the possibility of a hidden intention—however wild the idea—behind that posture; some secret agreement between Milly's whim and a horrifying, secret obsession. But since Mrs. Stringham stood as still as if any sound would trigger a fatal start, even the passage of a few seconds had a partly reassuring effect. It gave her time to receive an impression which, when she slowly retraced her steps a few minutes later, would be the most vivid she took away with her. This was the impression that if the girl was deeply and recklessly contemplating something there, she wasn’t contemplating a jump; on the contrary, as she sat, she was more in a state of elevated and limitless possession that had nothing to gain from a violent act. She was looking down on all the world, and while that in itself could be overwhelming, she wasn't considering renouncing it. Was she choosing among the kingdoms of the earth, or did she want them all? This question, before Mrs. Stringham had decided what to do, made all others irrelevant. So she realized, or thought she did, that while it might be dangerous to call out, to in any way startle her, it would probably be safe enough to leave as she had come.

Not many minutes probably, yet they had not
seemed few, and they had given her so much to
think of, not only while creeping home, but while
waiting afterwards at the inn, that she was still busy
with them when, late in the afternoon, Milly reappeared.
She had stopped at the point of the path
where the Tauchnitz lay, had taken it up and, with
the pencil attached to her watch-guard, had scrawled
a word—<i>à bientôt!</i>—across the cover; then, even
under the girl's continued delay, had measured time
without a return of alarm. For she now saw that
the great thing she had brought away was precisely
a conviction that the future was not to exist for
her princess in the form of any sharp or simple release
from the human predicament. It wouldn't
be for her a question of a flying leap and thereby
of a quick escape. It would be a question of taking
full in the face the whole assault of life, to the
general muster of which indeed her face might
have been directly presented as she sat there on
her rock. Mrs. Stringham was thus able to say
to herself, even after another interval of some
length, that if her young friend still continued absent
it wouldn't be because—whatever the opportunity—she
had cut short the thread. She
wouldn't have committed suicide; she knew herself
unmistakably reserved for some more complicated
passage; this was the very vision in which
she had, with no little awe, been discovered. The
image that thus remained with the elder lady kept
the character of revelation. During the breathless
minutes of her watch she had seen her companion
afresh; the latter's type, aspect, marks, her history,
her state, her beauty, her mystery, all unconsciously
betrayed themselves to the Alpine air, and all had
been gathered in again to feed Mrs. Stringham's
flame. They are things that will more distinctly
appear for us, and they are meanwhile briefly represented
by the enthusiasm that was stronger on
our friend's part than any doubt. It was a consciousness
she was scarce yet used to carrying, but
she had as beneath her feet a mine of something
precious. She seemed to herself to stand near the
mouth, not yet quite cleared. The mine but needed
working and would certainly yield a treasure. She
was not thinking, either, of Milly's gold.

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Milly meets Mrs. Stringham and asks if they can leave their current location the next morning instead of stopping there. Mrs. Stringham agrees.</p><p>Later, Milly asks Mrs. Stringham what Dr. Finch said to her in a private meeting in New York. Mrs. Stringham replies that the doctor said nothing of consequence. Milly admits she only guessed that the meeting took place. A conversation follows in which Mrs. Stringham asks if Milly is unwell. Milly says she is not in pain but makes several cryptic comments about her life and happiness. When Mrs. Stringham offers to find a doctor, Milly says she will decide on their destination at supper, and then leaves the room.</p><p>At supper, Milly announces she wants to go to London. Mrs. Stringham mentions a potential acquaintance there, Mr. Merton Densher, but Milly says he is still in America. Mrs. Stringham then speaks of her own estranged school friend, Maud Manningham (now Mrs. Lowder), who lives in London and suggests she might try to contact her. Milly encourages her to do so and then goes to bed. Alone, Mrs. Stringham gets out her portfolio and writes a letter.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study.</p><p>### Milly Theale
</p><ul><li>**Presentation:** Milly is introduced as deeply preoccupied and forgetful, signs of a significant internal state that soon surfaces. She is enigmatic and speaks in evasive, almost poetic metaphors when questioned about her well-being, describing her potential ailment as an inability to "resist the bliss of what I have." This behavior perplexes and concerns her companion. She has a "constant white face" but also a "mocking light" in her expression, suggesting a complex mix of physical fragility and sharp intelligence.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Milly abruptly moves from a state of passive unease to decisive action. She engineers an immediate change in their travel plans, first urging a departure and then, after a tense and indirect conversation about her health, declaring a specific destination: London. Her stated reason is a sudden, urgent desire for "people," which she connects to a sense that her time may be limited. Her feigned forgetfulness and subsequent contradictory statements about Mr. Densher suggest he is an unstated, significant motive for this shift.</li><p>### Mrs. Stringham (Susan Shepherd)
</p><li>**Presentation:** Mrs. Stringham is presented as an intensely observant, intuitive, and accommodating companion. She instantly perceives Milly's distress and agrees to her wishes without question, attempting to ease the situation with gentle humor. She is startled and frightened by Milly’s abrupt questions about the doctor, revealing a protective and deeply caring nature. While she is often "put off" and confused by Milly's cryptic manner, her primary response is always one of earnest, tender concern.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Initially a responsive caretaker reacting to Milly's moods, Mrs. Stringham is spurred into a proactive role by the decision to go to London. She seizes the opportunity to propose reconnecting with a long-lost school friend, Maud Lowder. This practical suggestion is revealed to be driven by a more personal motivation: a desire for "poetic justice" after feeling socially "shunted" by Maud years ago. Milly becomes her "trophy," and Mrs. Stringham ends the scene by immediately taking action and writing a letter, shifting from follower to facilitator.</li></ul>

The girl said nothing, when they met, about the
words scrawled on the Tauchnitz, and Mrs. Stringham
then noticed that she had not the book with
her. She had left it lying and probably would
never remember it at all. Her comrade's decision
was therefore quickly made not to speak of having
followed her; and within five minutes of her return,
wonderfully enough, the preoccupation denoted by
her forgetfulness further declared itself. "Should
you think me quite abominable if I were to say that
after all——?"
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The girl didn't mention the words written in the Tauchnitz book when they met. Mrs. Stringham then realized the girl didn't even have the book with her. She'd left it somewhere and probably wouldn't even remember it. So, Mrs. Stringham quickly decided not to say anything about having followed her. Amazingly, within five minutes of the girl returning, her forgetfulness indicated she was still preoccupied. "Would you think I'm awful if I said that, after all...?"</i></p></div>

<p>
Mrs. Stringham had already thought, with the
first sound of the question, everything she was capable
of thinking, and had immediately made such a
sign that Milly's words gave place to visible relief
at her assent. "You don't care for our stop here—you'd
rather go straight on? We'll start then
with the peep of to-morrow's dawn—or as early as
you like; it's only rather late now to take the road
again." And she smiled to show how she meant it
for a joke that an instant onward rush was what the
girl would have wished. "I bullied you into stopping,"
she added; "so it serves me right."
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>As soon as Mrs. Stringham heard the question, she'd already considered everything she possibly could, and quickly signaled her agreement. Milly's expression visibly relaxed when she saw this. "You don't want to stay here – you'd rather go straight on? We can leave at dawn tomorrow – or whenever you like. It's just a little late to travel now." And she smiled, as if to suggest that the girl actually wanted to rush off immediately. "I forced you to stop," she added, "so I deserve this."</i></p></div>

<p>
Milly made in general the most of her good
friend's jokes; but she humoured this one a little
absently. "Oh yes, you do bully me." And it
was thus arranged between them, with no discussion
at all, that they would resume their journey in
the morning. The younger tourist's interest in the
detail of the matter—in spite of a declaration from
the elder that she would consent to be dragged anywhere—appeared
almost immediately afterwards
quite to lose itself; she promised, however, to think
till supper of where, with the world all before them,
they might go—supper having been ordered for
such time as permitted of lighted candles. It had
been agreed between them that lighted candles at
wayside inns, in strange countries, amid mountain
scenery, gave the evening meal a peculiar poetry—such
being the mild adventures, the refinements of
impression, that they, as they would have said, went
in for. It was now as if, before this repast, Milly
had designed to "lie down"; but at the end of
three minutes more she was not lying down, she
was saying instead, abruptly, with a transition that
was like a jump of four thousand miles: "What
was it that, in New York, on the ninth, when you
saw him alone, Dr. Finch said to you?"
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly usually enjoyed her friend's jokes, but she responded to this one with a bit of a distracted air. "Oh yes, you do pick on me." And that's how it was settled between them, without any argument, that they'd continue their trip the next day. The younger woman's curiosity about the specifics of their plans – even though the older woman had said she'd go anywhere – seemed to vanish almost instantly. However, she promised to consider where they might go, with the whole world open to them, until dinner. Dinner had been scheduled for when they could have candles. They'd agreed that lit candles in country inns, in foreign lands, surrounded by mountains, added a special beauty to their evening meals – these were the subtle thrills, the heightened experiences they loved. Now, as if before the meal, Milly had been about to "lie down" for a nap, but three minutes later, she wasn't lying down. Instead, she said suddenly, shifting topics as if she’d teleported across the world: "What did Dr. Finch say to you in New York on the ninth, when you saw him alone?"</i></p></div>
</details>
</div><div class="section-block">
<div class="original-text">
<p>
It was not till later that Mrs. Stringham fully
knew why the question had startled her still more
than its suddenness explained; though the effect of
it even at the moment was almost to frighten her
into a false answer. She had to think, to remember
the occasion, the "ninth," in New York, the time
she had seen Dr. Finch alone, and to recall what
he had then said to her; and when everything had
come back it was quite, at first, for a moment, as
if he had said something that immensely mattered.
He hadn't, however, in fact; it was only as if he
might perhaps after all have been going to. It
was on the sixth—within ten days of their sailing—that
she had hurried from Boston under the
alarm, a small but a sufficient shock, of hearing that
Mildred had suddenly been taken ill, had had, from
some obscure cause, such an upset as threatened to
stay their journey. The bearing of the accident
had happily soon announced itself as slight, and
there had been, in the event, but a few hours of anxiety;
the journey had been pronounced again not
only possible, but, as representing "change," highly
advisable; and if the zealous guest had had five
minutes by herself with the doctor, that was, clearly,
no more at his instance than at her own. Almost
nothing had passed between them but an easy exchange
of enthusiasms in respect to the remedial
properties of "Europe"; and this assurance, as the
facts came back to her, she was now able to give.
"Nothing whatever, on my word of honour, that
you mayn't know or mightn't then have known.
I've no secret with him about you. What makes
you suspect it? I don't quite make out how you
know I did see him alone."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Mrs. Stringham didn't understand why the question had surprised her so much, even more than its unexpectedness had. The question almost made her give the wrong answer out of fear. She had to pause, think back to the situation, the "ninth" in New York. That's when she had seen Dr. Finch by himself, and had to remember what he'd said to her then. When everything came back to her, it was as if he had said something incredibly important. But he hadn't, not really. It was only as if he possibly might have, in the end. It was on the sixth – within ten days of their departure – that she had rushed from Boston, alarmed, a small but significant shock, to hear that Mildred had suddenly fallen ill. Mildred had been hit with some mysterious sickness that threatened to make them cancel their trip. Luckily, the problem quickly proved not serious, and there were only a few hours of worry. The trip was declared possible again, and even highly recommended as a “change of scenery”. If the eager guest had had five minutes alone with the doctor, it was clearly because she wanted to, just as much as he did. Almost nothing was said between them, just an easy discussion of how amazing "Europe" was for recovery, and as she remembered, she could now confirm that. “Honestly, there was nothing you don’t know, or that you couldn’t have known back then. I have no secrets with him about you. Why do you suspect it? I'm not sure how you know I saw him alone.”</i></p></div>

That's exactly why!" Milly declared—with something
in her face and voice that, the next moment,
betrayed for her companion that she had really
known nothing, had only conjectured and, chancing
her charge, made a hit. Yet why had her mind
been busy with the question? "But if you're not,

The elder woman was earnest for the truth,
though the possibility she named was not at all the
one that seemed to fit—witness the long climb
Milly had just indulged in. The girl showed her
constant white face, but that her friends had all
learned to discount, and it was often brightest when
superficially not bravest. She continued for a little

Milly had for the third time her air of consideration;
but she came back with it to her plea of some
minutes before. "I'll tell you at supper—good-bye
till then." And she left the room with a lightness
that testified for her companion to something
that again particularly pleased her in the renewed
promise of motion. The odd passage just concluded,
Mrs. Stringham mused as she once more sat
alone with a hooked needle and a ball of silk, the
"fine" work with which she was always provided—this
mystifying mood had simply been precipitated,
no doubt, by their prolonged halt, with which
the girl hadn't really been in sympathy. One had
only to admit that her complaint was in fact but the
excess of the joy of life, and everything <i>did</i> then
fit. She couldn't stop for the joy, but she could
go on for it, and with the sense of going on she
floated again, was restored to her great spaces.
There was no evasion of any truth—so at least
Susan Shepherd hoped—in one's sitting there while
the twilight deepened and feeling still more finely
that the position of this young lady was magnificent.
The evening at that height had naturally
turned to cold, and the travellers had bespoken a
fire with their meal; the great Alpine road asserted
its brave presence through the small panes of the
low, clean windows, with incidents at the inn-door,
the yellow <i>diligence,</i> the great waggons, the hurrying,
hooded, private conveyances, reminders, for
our fanciful friend, of old stories, old pictures, historic
flights, escapes, pursuits, things that had happened,
things indeed that by a sort of strange congruity
helped her to read the meanings of the
greatest interest into the relation in which she was
now so deeply involved. It was natural that this
record of the magnificence of her companion's position
should strike her as, after all, the best meaning
she could extract; for she herself was seated in
the magnificence as in a court-carriage—she came
back to that, and such a method of progression,
such a view from crimson cushions, would evidently
have a great deal more to give. By the time the
candles were lighted for supper and the short, white
curtains were drawn, Milly had reappeared, and the
little scenic room had then all its romance. That
charm moreover was far from broken by the words
in which she, without further loss of time, satisfied
her patient mate. "I want to go straight to London."

Mrs. Stringham pondered the strange conversation she'd just had as she sat alone again with her needle and silk, her "fine" needlework that she always kept with her. This puzzling mood, she thought, was probably just caused by their extended stop, which the girl hadn't really liked. You just had to accept that Milly's restlessness was actually an overflow of her joy for life, and then everything made sense. She couldn't pause for the joy, but she could continue moving for it, and the feeling of continuing allowed her to float again, returning her to a sense of freedom.

It was unexpected, corresponding with no view
positively taken at their departure; when England
had appeared, on the contrary, rather relegated and
postponed—seen for the moment, as who should
say, at the end of an avenue of preparations and introductions.
London, in short, might have been
supposed to be the crown, and to be achieved like a
siege by gradual approaches. Milly's actual fine
stride was therefore the more exciting, as any simplification
almost always was to Mrs. Stringham;
who, besides, was afterwards to recall as the very
beginning of a drama the terms in which, between
their smoky candles, the girl had put her preference
and in which still other things had come up, come
while the clank of waggon-chains in the sharp air
reached their ears, with the stamp of hoofs, the rattle
of buckets and the foreign questions, foreign
answers, that were all alike a part of the cheery converse
of the road. The girl brought it out in truth
as she might have brought a huge confession, something
she admitted herself shy about and that would
seem to show her as frivolous; it had rolled over
her that what she wanted of Europe was "people,"
so far as they were to be had, and that if her friend
really wished to know, the vision of this same equivocal
quantity was what had haunted her during
their previous days, in museums and churches, and
what was again spoiling for her the pure taste of
scenery. She was all for scenery—yes; but she
wanted it human and personal, and all she could say
was that there would be in London—wouldn't
there? more of that kind than anywhere else. She
came back to her idea that if it wasn't for long—if
nothing should happen to be so for <i>her</i>—why, the
particular thing she spoke of would probably have
most to give her in the time, would probably be
less than anything else a waste of her remainder.
She produced this last consideration indeed with
such gaiety that Mrs. Stringham was not again disconcerted
by it, was in fact quite ready—if talk of
early dying was in order—to match it from her own
future. Good, then; they would, eat and drink because
of what might happen to-morrow; and they
would direct their course from that moment with a
view to such eating and drinking. They ate and
drank that night, in truth, as if in the spirit of this
decision; whereby the air, before they separated,
felt itself the clearer.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was surprising, because it wasn't what they'd planned when they left. England had seemed, in fact, to be put off, delayed—something that would come later, after all the preliminary steps. In other words, London was supposed to be the ultimate goal, something they'd reach gradually, like a city under siege. So, Milly's sudden, direct move there was even more exciting, as any shortcut always was to Mrs. Stringham. Mrs. Stringham also remembered this as the very beginning of a story, recalling the way the girl, by the light of their flickering candles, had expressed her preference. Other things came up too, as the sounds of wagon chains, horses' hooves, and buckets filled the cold air, along with the foreign questions and answers that were just part of the lively chatter of the road. The girl revealed it all almost as if it were a major confession, something she felt embarrassed about, as though it made her seem superficial. It had suddenly hit her that what she wanted from Europe, as much as possible, was "people." If her friend really wanted to know, the thought of these people was what had been on her mind during their earlier days, in museums and churches, and what was now ruining her enjoyment of the scenery. She did love the scenery, yes, but she wanted it to be connected to people, and all she could say was that there would be more of that in London—wouldn't there?—than anywhere else. She returned to her belief that if her time was short—if something happened to her—then this particular thing she was talking about would probably give her the most in the time she had left, and would probably be less of a waste of her remaining time than anything else. She said this last part so cheerfully that Mrs. Stringham wasn't upset by it, and, in fact, was ready—if talking about dying young was the subject—to offer her own similar thoughts about her own future. Fine, then; they would eat and drink because of what might happen tomorrow; and from that moment on, they would plan their trip with that goal in mind. They did eat and drink that night, as if they were truly committed to this decision; and before they separated, the air felt lighter.</i></p></div>

It had cleared perhaps to a view only too extensive—extensive,
that is, in proportion to the signs
of life presented. The idea of "people" was not
so entertained on Milly's part as to connect itself
with particular persons, and the fact remained for
each of the ladies that they would, completely unknown,
disembark at Dover amid the completely
unknowing. They had no relation already formed;
this plea Mrs. Stringham put forward to see what it
would produce. It produced nothing at first but
the observation on the girl's side that what she had
in mind was no thought of society nor of scraping
acquaintance; nothing was further from her than
to desire the opportunities represented for the compatriot
in general by a trunkful of "letters." It
wasn't a question, in short, of the people the compatriot
was after; it was the human, the English
picture itself, as they might see it in their own way—the
world imagined always in what one had read
and dreamed. Mrs. Stringham did every justice to
this world, but when later on an occasion chanced
to present itself, she made a point of not omitting
to remark that it might be a comfort to know in
advance even an individual. This still, however,
failed in vulgar parlance, to "fetch" Milly, so that
she had presently to go all the way. "Haven't I
understood from you, for that matter, that you gave
Mr. Densher something of a promise?"
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The view had cleared, maybe a little *too* much. It was expansive, I mean, considering how few signs of life there were. Milly wasn't thinking about "people" in a way that involved specific individuals. The fact remained for both women: they would arrive in Dover, completely strangers, among people who didn't know them at all. They didn't have any connections yet. That was Mrs. Stringham's point, to see what would come of it. At first, it produced nothing except Milly's remark that she wasn't thinking about socializing or making small talk. Nothing could be further from her mind than pursuing the social opportunities that having a suitcase full of "letters" would bring to the average American. In short, she wasn't looking for the kinds of people an American might be after. She was interested in the human, English experience itself, how they might see it their own way—the world always imagined through what they had read and dreamed. Mrs. Stringham appreciated this perspective. But later, when the opportunity arose, she made it a point to say that it might be helpful to know even one person beforehand. This still, to put it plainly, didn't "click" with Milly. So Mrs. Stringham had to go further: "Didn't you tell me that you gave Mr. Densher some sort of a promise?"</i></p></div>
</details>
</div><div class="section-block">
<div class="original-text">
<p>
There was a moment, on this, when Milly's look
had to be taken as representing one of two things—either
that she was completely vague about the
promise or that Mr. Densher's name itself started
no train. But she really couldn't be so vague about
the promise, her interlocutress quickly saw, without
attaching it to something; it had to be a promise
to somebody in particular to be so repudiated. In
the event, accordingly, she acknowledged Mr. Merton
Densher, the so unusually clever young Englishman
who had made his appearance in New York
on some special literary business—wasn't it?—shortly
before their departure, and who had been
three or four times in her house during the
brief period between her visit to Boston and her
companion's subsequent stay with her; but she required
much reminding before it came back to her
that she had mentioned to this companion just
afterwards the confidence expressed by the personage
in question in her never doing so dire a thing
as to come to London without, as the phrase was,
looking a fellow up. She had left him the enjoyment
of his confidence, the form of which might have
appeared a trifle free—that she now reasserted; she
had done nothing either to impair or to enhance it;
but she had also left Mrs. Stringham, in the connection
and at the time, rather sorry to have missed Mr.
Densher. She had thought of him again after that,
the elder woman; she had likewise gone so far as to
notice that Milly appeared not to have done so—which
the girl might easily have betrayed; and, interested
as she was in everything that concerned
her, she had made out for herself, for herself only
and rather idly, that, but for interruptions, the
young Englishman might have become a better acquaintance.
His being an acquaintance at all was
one of the signs that in the first days had helped to
place Milly, as a young person with the world before
her, for sympathy and wonder. Isolated, unmothered,
unguarded, but with her other strong
marks, her big house, her big fortune, her big freedom,
she had lately begun to "receive," for all her
few years, as an older woman might have done—as
was done, precisely, by princesses who had public
considerations to observe and who came of age
very early. If it was thus distinct to Mrs. Stringham
then that Mr. Densher had gone off somewhere
else in connection with his errand before her
visit to New York, it had been also not undiscoverable
that he had come back for a day or two later on,
that is after her own second excursion—that he had
in fine reappeared on a single occasion on his way
to the West: his way from Washington as she believed,
though he was out of sight at the time of her
joining her friend for their departure. It had not
occurred to her before to exaggerate—it had not
occurred to her that she could; but she seemed to
become aware to-night that there had been just
enough in this relation to meet, to provoke, the
free conception of a little more.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>For a moment, it seemed Milly's reaction could mean one of two things: either she completely forgot about the promise, or the name "Mr. Densher" didn't ring any bells. However, her friend quickly realized Milly couldn't be so vague without linking the promise to something. It had to be a promise to a specific person to be rejected like that. So, Milly acknowledged Mr. Merton Densher, the exceptionally intelligent young Englishman who had arrived in New York for some literary work shortly before they left, and who had visited her several times during the short time between her trip to Boston and her companion's subsequent stay. But she needed a lot of prompting to remember that she'd mentioned to her companion afterward that Mr. Densher was confident she wouldn't do something so awful as come to London without, as they said, looking him up. Milly had let him enjoy that confidence, the casualness of which she now acknowledged. She hadn't done anything to encourage or discourage it. However, she also remembered that Mrs. Stringham, at the time, had been a bit disappointed to have missed Mr. Densher. The older woman had thought about him again later, and she had also noticed that Milly didn't seem to have given him any thought—something the girl could easily have revealed. Mrs. Stringham, being interested in everything related to Milly, had privately and somewhat casually concluded that, without interruptions, the young Englishman might have become a better friend. His being an acquaintance at all was one of the signs that had helped establish Milly as a young woman with a world of possibilities before her, someone to be admired and pitied. Alone, without a mother, unprotected, but with her other advantages—her large house, her great wealth, her freedom—she had recently begun "receiving," as older women did, like princesses who had public duties and matured very quickly. If Mrs. Stringham understood that Mr. Densher had left for another location for his work before her trip to New York, she also realized that he had returned for a day or two afterward—that is, after her second trip—and had, in short, reappeared only once on his way West: on his way from Washington, she believed, though she didn't see him when she met her friend to leave. She hadn't thought to overstate the situation before tonight, or thought she could. But tonight she realized there had been just enough in their relationship to invite, to encourage, the idea of something more.</i></p></div>

<p>
She presently put it that, at any rate, promise or
no promise, Milly would, at a pinch, be able, in
London, to act on his permission to make him a
sign; to which Milly replied with readiness that her
ability, though evident, would be none the less quite
wasted, inasmuch as the gentleman would, to a certainty,
be still in America. He had a great deal to
do there—which he would scarce have begun; and
in fact she might very well not have thought of
London at all if she hadn't been sure he wasn't yet
near coming back. It was perceptible to her companion
that the moment our young woman had so
far committed herself she had a sense of having
overstepped; which was not quite patched up by
her saying the next minute, possibly with a certain
failure of presence of mind, that the last thing she
desired was the air of running after him. Mrs.
Stringham wondered privately what question there
could be of any such appearance—the danger of
which thus suddenly came up; but she said, for the
time, nothing of it—she only said other things: one
of which was, for instance, that if Mr. Densher was
away he was away, and that this was the end of it;
also that of course they must be discreet at any
price. But what was the measure of discretion,
and how was one to be sure? So it was that, as
they sat there, she produced her own case: <i>she</i> had
a possible tie with London, which she desired as
little to disown as she might wish to risk presuming
on it. She treated her companion, in short, for
their evening's end, to the story of Maud Manningham,
the odd but interesting English girl who had
formed her special affinity in the old days at the
Vevey school; whom she had written to, after their
separation, with a regularity that had at first faltered
and then altogether failed, yet that had been for
the time quite a fine case of crude constancy; so
that it had in fact flickered up again of itself on the
occasion of the marriage of each. They had then
once more fondly, scrupulously written—Mrs.
Lowder first; and even another letter or two had
afterwards passed. This, however, had been the
end—though with no rupture, only a gentle drop:
Maud Manningham had made, she believed, a great
marriage, while she herself had made a small; on
top of which, moreover, distance, difference, diminished
community and impossible reunion had done
the rest of the work. It was but after all these years
that reunion had begun to show as possible—if the
other party to it, that is, should be still in existence.
That was exactly what it now struck our friend as
interesting to ascertain, as, with one aid and another,
she believed she might. It was an experiment
she would at all events now make if Milly
didn't object.
</p>
</div>

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She then stated that, regardless of any promises, Milly could, if necessary, use his permission to signal him in London. Milly readily replied that, although she could do it, it wouldn't matter because he would definitely still be in America. He had a lot to do there, which he probably hadn't even started. In fact, she might not have even thought about London if she wasn't certain he wasn't coming back soon. Her friend noticed that as soon as Milly said this, she seemed to realize she'd said too much. Her next comment, maybe a little flustered, didn't really fix it: that the last thing she wanted was to seem like she was chasing after him. Mrs. Stringham privately wondered why there was any concern about appearing that way, but she said nothing about it then. She just said other things: for instance, that if Mr. Densher was away, he was away, and that was that. Also, that they of course had to be discreet. But how discreet was discreet, and how could they be sure? So, as they sat there, she told her own story: she had a possible connection to London that she didn't want to deny, but also didn't want to presume upon. She shared the story of Maud Manningham, the peculiar but interesting English girl who had been her close friend at school in Vevey. After they parted, she had written to her regularly, though it had eventually stopped, but it was a sign of real devotion at the time; in fact, the letters had started up again around each of their weddings. They had then written to each other again with affection and care—Mrs. Lowder first—and even sent a couple more letters after that. But then it ended, though not with a fight, just a gradual fade. Maud Manningham had, she thought, married into wealth, while she herself had married into less; and on top of that, distance, different lives, less in common, and no chance of getting back together had finished it off. But after all these years, a reunion seemed possible—if the other person, that is, was still alive. That was exactly what she now found interesting to find out, and she believed she could with some help. She was going to try it now, unless Milly objected.</i></p></div>

Milly in general objected to nothing, and, though
she asked a question or two, she raised no
present plea. Her questions—or at least her own
answers to them—kindled, on Mrs. Stringham's
part, a backward train: she hadn't known till tonight
how much she remembered, or how fine it
might be to see what had become of large, high-coloured
Maud, florid, exotic and alien—which had
been just the spell—even to the perceptions of
youth. There was the danger—she frankly touched
it—that such a temperament mightn't have matured,
with the years, all in the sense of fineness;
it was the sort of danger that, in renewing relations
after long breaks, one had always to look in the face.
To gather in strayed threads was to take a risk—for
which, however, she was prepared if Milly was.
The possible "fun," she confessed, was by itself
rather tempting; and she fairly sounded, with this—wound
up a little as she was—the note of fun as
the harmless final right of fifty years of mere New
England virtue. Among the things she was afterwards
to recall was the indescribable look dropped
on her, at this, by her companion; she was still
seated there between the candles and before the
finished supper, while Milly moved about, and the
look was long to figure for her as an inscrutable
comment on <i>her</i> notion of freedom. Challenged,
at any rate, as for the last wise word, Milly showed
perhaps, musingly, charmingly, that, though her
attention had been mainly soundless, her friend's
story—produced as a resource unsuspected, a card
from up the sleeve—half surprised, half beguiled
her. Since the matter, such as it was, depended on
that, she brought out, before she went to bed, an
easy, a light "Risk everything!"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly was generally agreeable and didn't object to anything, though she asked a few questions. She didn't voice any immediate concerns. Her questions – or at least her own answers – triggered a flood of memories in Mrs. Stringham. She hadn't realized until that evening how much she remembered, or how interesting it would be to see what had become of the vibrant, exotic, and different Maud. That difference had been part of her allure, even when they were young. There was a risk, she admitted frankly, that such a fiery personality might not have developed gracefully with age. It was a risk you had to face when reconnecting with someone after a long time apart. Reconnecting and gathering up old friendships always carried a chance of disappointment, but she was willing to take that chance if Milly was. The potential "fun," she confessed, was quite tempting in itself, and she almost reveled in this – fueled by a little excitement – as the harmless final reward of a lifetime of simple, moral living. One of the things she would later remember was the indescribable look Milly gave her at this moment. Mrs. Stringham was still sitting there between the candles, the supper finished, while Milly moved around. That look would linger in her memory as a mysterious comment on her idea of freedom. It was as if Milly was offering the final, wise word. Milly seemed to show, thoughtfully and charmingly, that although she'd been mostly quiet, her friend's story—presented as an unexpected option, a secret weapon—had partly surprised and partly charmed her. Since the whole thing depended on Milly's willingness, she said easily and lightly, before going to bed, "Risk everything!"</i></p></div>

This quality in it seemed possibly a little to deny
weight to Maud Lowder's evoked presence—as
Susan Stringham, still sitting up, became, in excited
reflection, a trifle more conscious. Something determinant,
when the girl had left her, took place in
her—nameless but, as soon as she had given way,
coercive. It was as if she knew again, in this fulness
of time, that she had been, after Maud's marriage,
just sensibly outlived or, as people nowadays
said, shunted. Mrs. Lowder had left her behind,
and on the occasion, subsequently, of the corresponding
date in her own life—not the second, the
sad one, with its dignity of sadness, but the first,
with the meagreness of its supposed felicity—she
had been, in the same spirit, almost patronisingly
pitied. If that suspicion, even when it had ceased
to matter, had never quite died out for her, there
was doubtless some oddity in its now offering itself
as a link, rather than as another break, in the chain;
and indeed there might well have been for her a
mood in which the notion of the development of
patronage in her quondam schoolmate would have
settled her question in another sense. It was actually
settled—if the case be worth our analysis—by
the happy consummation, the poetic justice, the
generous revenge, of her having at last something
to show. Maud, on their parting company, had
appeared to have so much, and would now—for
wasn't it also, in general, quite the rich law of English
life?—have, with accretions, promotions, expansions,
ever so much more. Very good; such
things might be; she rose to the sense of being
ready for them. Whatever Mrs. Lowder might
have to show—and one hoped one did the presumptions
all justice—she would have nothing like Milly
Theale, who constituted the trophy producible by
poor Susan. Poor Susan lingered late—till the
candles were low, and as soon as the table was
cleared she opened her neat portfolio. She had not
lost the old clue; there were connections she remembered,
addresses she could try; so the thing
was to begin. She wrote on the spot.

Something decisive, which she couldn't name, took hold of her as soon as the girl had left—but it was compelling. It was as if, now, at this moment, she understood again that after Maud's marriage, she had just been, in a sensible way, left behind, or, as people say today, sidelined. Mrs. Lowder had outpaced her, and on the occasion of the anniversary of her own life—not the second, sad one, with its dignified sadness, but the first, with its supposedly meager happiness—she had been, in a similar spirit, almost condescendingly pitied. Even though that feeling had faded, it had never completely vanished; and there was probably something strange in it now appearing as a connection, rather than another barrier, in their relationship.

Very well; those things might be; Susan felt ready to face them. Whatever Mrs. Lowder might have to show—and she hoped she was fairly assessing the situation—she wouldn't have anything like Milly Theale, who represented the achievement that poor Susan could now display.

<div class="summary-box">
<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Milly and her companion, Susie Stringham, are at a dinner party at Lancaster Gate, hosted by Mrs. Lowder. Milly is seated next to a gentleman, Lord Mark, and tells him she barely knows where she is. There are twenty people at the table.</p><p>Before dinner, Mrs. Lowder's niece, Kate Croy, introduced Lord Mark to Milly, and he escorted her to the table. During the meal, Milly observes Kate across the table, and their eyes meet.</p><p>Milly and Lord Mark have a long conversation. He tells her that London society has no real "sets," calls Mrs. Lowder an "extraordinary woman," and says Kate is "tremendously... good-looking." Milly recounts to him that Mrs. Lowder invited them to dine soon after their arrival and visited their hotel with Kate.</p><p>Lord Mark tells Milly that she is a social success and is being "jumped at." He asks what Mrs. Lowder knows about her, and says he will observe what Mrs. Lowder "does with" her. When Milly asks what their hostess knows about him, he says "Nothing," and that Milly is now Mrs. Lowder's best new acquisition. Milly asks what he meant by Mrs. Lowder doing something with her, and he replies that she will "get her money back" because "nobody here, you know, does anything for nothing."</p><p>Milly calls Mrs. Lowder an idealist. She tells Lord Mark that he and the others are familiar with everything but have no imagination. She then asks him what Kate has to gain from being welcoming to her. As she asks, Kate looks over at them. Lord Mark replies that Kate gains Milly’s acquaintance. Milly suggests Kate's motive is pity. Lord Mark says he is not sorry for Milly at all. He admits he does not understand Kate and asks Milly to tell him about her when she knows more. Milly concludes that Kate must be difficult, while she herself is easy.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
Milly is presented as a highly sensitive and observant American, newly thrust into a sophisticated English social scene. Her situation has shifted with dizzying speed from that of a tourist to the center of attention at a formal dinner, leaving her feeling disoriented yet exhilarated. She is acutely conscious of being evaluated, analyzing everyone around her while aware that she herself is being "jumped at." She is prone to seeing her situation in romantic terms ("fairy-tale") but is also immediately perceptive of complex social dynamics and "possibly sinister motive."
<li>*Susie (Mrs. Stringham)**</li>
Milly's companion, Susie, is presented through Milly's eyes as a triumphant "fairy godmother." Her situation has shifted from being a traveling friend to the successful orchestrator of Milly's social debut. She now "glitters" with a sense of success, content with the results of her efforts.
<li>*Lord Mark**</li>
Lord Mark is Milly's dinner partner and is presented as a collection of contradictions: he looks both old and young, seems both "intellectual" and "frivolous," and acts both clever and indifferent. As a member of the aristocracy, he is world-weary and speaks cynically of London society, yet he is also perceptive. He immediately categorizes Milly as a predictable American "type" but also declares her a "success," engaging her in a probing, almost intimate conversation.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Referred to as "the handsome girl," Kate is presented primarily through her striking beauty and "eminence." She is positioned as a figure of great interest and mystery. Though she appears "charming" and "frankly conscious" of friendship, Milly senses she is a complex individual whom even insiders like Lord Mark cannot "make out." Her situation is that of an established social figure who immediately fascinates the newcomer, Milly.
<li>*Mrs. Lowder**</li></ul>
The hostess is presented as a powerful and substantial figure, described as "massive" and a "great reality." Her situation has shifted from being a distant acquaintance of Susie's to the formidable architect of the evening. She is perceived by Milly as an "idealist," but there are immediate hints that she is a pragmatic social operator who is using Lord Mark to assess Milly's "value."
        </div>
</details><div class="section-block">
<div class="original-text">
<p>
It had all gone so fast after this that Milly uttered
but the truth nearest to hand in saying to the
gentleman on her right—who was, by the same
token, the gentleman on her hostess's left—that she
scarce even then knew where she was: the words
marking her first full sense of a situation really romantic.
They were already dining, she and her
friend, at Lancaster Gate, and surrounded, as it
seemed to her, with every English accessory; though
her consciousness of Mrs. Lowder's existence, and
still more of her remarkable identity, had been of so
recent and so sudden a birth. Susie, as she was apt
to call her companion for a lighter change, had only
had to wave a neat little wand for the fairy-tale to
begin at once; in consequence of which Susie now
glittered—for, with Mrs. Stringham's new sense of
success, it came to that—in the character of a fairy
godmother. Milly had almost insisted on dressing
her, for the present occasion, as one; and it was no
fault of the girl's if the good lady had not now appeared
in a peaked hat, a short petticoat and diamond
shoe-buckles, brandishing the magic crutch.
The good lady, in truth, bore herself not less contentedly
than if these insignia had marked her
work; and Milly's observation to Lord Mark had
just been, doubtless, the result of such a light exchange
of looks with her as even the great length
of the table had not baffled. There were twenty
persons between them, but this sustained passage
was the sharpest sequel yet to that other comparison
of views during the pause on the Swiss pass.
It almost appeared to Milly that their fortune had
been unduly precipitated—as if, properly, they were
in the position of having ventured on a small joke
and found the answer out of proportion grave.
She could not at this moment, for instance, have
said whether, with her quickened perceptions, she
were more enlivened or oppressed; and the case
might in fact have been serious had she not, by
good fortune, from the moment the picture loomed,
quickly made up her mind that what finally most
concerned her was neither to seek nor to shirk,
was not even to wonder too much, but was to let
things come as they would, since there was little
enough doubt of how they would go.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Everything happened so quickly after that that Milly simply blurted out the first thing that came to mind to the man on her right – who also happened to be sitting on her hostess’s left – saying that she hardly even knew where she was. Those words were her first real acknowledgement of how incredibly romantic the situation felt. They were already at dinner, she and her friend, at Lancaster Gate, surrounded, as it seemed to her, by all things English. Even though she’d only just become aware of Mrs. Lowder’s presence, and even more so of her striking personality, it had all happened so suddenly. Susie, as she often called her friend to be more casual, had only had to wave her hand, and the fairytale began at once. As a result, Susie now glowed, because, with Mrs. Stringham’s newfound success, it really came down to that – in the role of a fairy godmother. Milly had almost insisted on dressing her, for this occasion, as one, and it was only through no fault of Susie’s that the good lady wasn’t currently wearing a pointed hat, a short petticoat, diamond shoe buckles, and waving a magic crutch.</i></p><p><i>In truth, the good lady seemed as pleased as if she were wearing those things to signify her efforts. Milly’s comment to Lord Mark had surely been prompted by a quick exchange of glances with Susie, a connection that the long table hadn’t managed to interrupt. Even though there were twenty people between them, this subtle conversation was the most obvious result of their earlier discussion while they paused on the Swiss pass.</i></p><p><i>Milly almost felt as though their fortunes had been rushed, as if they’d made a small joke and received a disproportionately serious response. She couldn’t say at that moment, with her sharper awareness, whether she was more excited or overwhelmed. It might actually have been a serious issue, if she hadn’t, luckily, decided from the moment the situation became clear that the most important thing was neither to seek nor to avoid, not even to overthink it. Instead, she chose to let things unfold as they would, since she had little doubt how they would turn out.</i></p></div>

<p>
Lord Mark had been brought to her before dinner—not
by Mrs. Lowder, but by the handsome
girl, that lady's niece, who was now at the other
end and on the same side as Susie; he had taken
her in, and she meant presently to ask him about
Miss Croy, the handsome girl, actually offered to
her sight—though now in a splendid way—but for
the second time. The first time had been the occasion—only
three days before—of her calling at
their hotel with her aunt and then making, for our
other two heroines, a great impression of beauty
and eminence. This impression had remained so
with Milly that, at present, and although her attention
was aware at the same time of everything
else, her eyes were mainly engaged with Kate
Croy when not engaged with Susie. That wonderful
creature's eyes moreover readily met them—she
ranked now as a wonderful creature; and
it seemed a part of the swift prosperity of the
American visitors that, so little in the original reckoning,
she should yet appear conscious, charmingly,
frankly conscious, of possibilities of friendship for
them. Milly had easily and, as a guest, gracefully
generalised: English girls had a special, strong
beauty, and it particularly showed in evening dress—above
all when, as was strikingly the case with
this one, the dress itself was what it should be.
That observation she had all ready for Lord Mark
when they should, after a little, get round to it.
She seemed even now to see that there might be a
good deal they would get round to; the indication
being that, taken up once for all with her other
neighbour, their hostess would leave them much to
themselves. Mrs. Lowder's other neighbour was
the Bishop of Murrum—a real bishop, such as Milly
had never seen, with a complicated costume, a voice
like an old-fashioned wind instrument, and a face
all the portrait of a prelate; while the gentleman on
our young lady's left, a gentleman thick-necked,
large and literal, who looked straight before him
and as if he were not to be diverted by vain words
from that pursuit, clearly counted as an offset to
the possession of Lord Mark. As Milly made out
these things—with a shade of exhilaration at the
way she already fell in—she saw how she was justified
of her plea for people and her love of life. It
wasn't then, as the prospect seemed to show, so difficult
to get into the current, or to stand, at any
rate, on the bank. It was easy to get near—if they
<i>were</i> near; and yet the elements were different
enough from any of her old elements, and positively
rich and strange.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Lord Mark had been introduced to her before dinner—not by Mrs. Lowder, but by the beautiful girl, Mrs. Lowder's niece, who was now seated at the far end of the table on the same side as Susie. He had escorted her to her seat, and Milly intended to ask him about Miss Croy, the attractive girl who was actually present—though in a glamorous way—for the second time. The first time had been just three days earlier, when she and her aunt had visited their hotel and made a strong impression of beauty and importance on the other two women. This impression had remained so strong with Milly that, even though she was aware of everything else happening, her attention was mostly focused on Kate Croy when she wasn't looking at Susie. That stunning woman's eyes readily met hers—she now seemed to be a truly remarkable person; and it seemed to be part of the American visitors' quick rise to success that, despite being so unexpected, she appeared aware, charmingly and openly, of the possibility of becoming friends with them. Milly had easily and gracefully generalized, as a guest does: English girls had a special, strong beauty, and it was particularly evident in evening gowns—especially when, as was very clear in this case, the dress itself was perfect. She already had that observation prepared to share with Lord Mark when they eventually got around to talking about it. She even felt that there might be a lot they would end up discussing; the implication being that their hostess, already absorbed with her other dinner partner, would leave them to themselves. Mrs. Lowder's other dinner partner was the Bishop of Murrum—a real bishop, the likes of whom Milly had never seen, with a complex outfit, a voice like an old-fashioned wind instrument, and a face straight out of a portrait of a prelate. Meanwhile, the gentleman on Milly's left, a thick-necked, large, and literal man who stared straight ahead and as if he couldn't be distracted by idle conversation from his own thoughts, seemed to balance out the presence of Lord Mark. As Milly understood all of this—with a touch of excitement at how easily she was fitting in—she realized that her faith in people and her love of life were justified. It wasn't as difficult as it seemed to get involved, or at least to stay on the periphery. It was easy to get close—if they were close; and yet the whole environment was different from anything she was used to, and positively rich and strange.</i></p></div>

She asked herself if her right-hand neighbour
would understand what she meant by such a description
of them, should she throw it off; but another
of the things to which, precisely, her sense
was awakened was that no, decidedly, he wouldn't.
It was nevertheless by this time open to her that
his line would be to be clever; and indeed, evidently,
no little of the interest was going to be in
the fresh reference and fresh effect both of people's
cleverness and of their simplicity. She thrilled, she
consciously flushed, and turned pale with the certitude—it
had never been so present—that she
should find herself completely involved: the very
air of the place, the pitch of the occasion, had for
her so positive a taste and so deep an undertone.
The smallest things, the faces, the hands, the jewels
of the women, the sound of words, especially of
names, across the table, the shape of the forks, the
arrangement of the flowers, the attitude of the servants,
the walls of the room, were all touches in a
picture and denotements in a play; and they marked
for her, moreover, her alertness of vision. She had
never, she might well believe, been in such a state
of vibration; her sensibility was almost too sharp
for her comfort: there were, for example, more indications
than she could reduce to order in the manner
of the friendly niece, who struck her as distinguished
and interesting, as in fact surprisingly
genial. This young woman's type had, visibly,
other possibilities; yet here, of its own free movement,
it had already sketched a relation. Were
they, Miss Croy and she, to take up the tale where
their two elders had left it off so many years before?—were
they to find they liked each other and to
try for themselves if a scheme of constancy on more
modern lines could be worked? She had doubted,
as they came to England, of Maud Manningham,
had believed her a broken reed and a vague resource,
had seen their dependence on her as a state
of mind that would have been shamefully silly—so
far as it <i>was</i> dependence—had they wished to do
any thing so inane as "get into society." To have
made their pilgrimage all for the sake of such society
as Mrs. Lowder might have in reserve for them—that
didn't bear thinking of at all, and she herself
had quite chosen her course for curiosity about
other matters. She would have described this curiosity
as a desire to see the places she had read about,
and <i>that</i> description of her motive she was prepared
to give her neighbour—even though, as a consequence
of it, he should find how little she had read.
It was almost at present as if her poor prevision had
been rebuked by the majesty—she could scarcely
call it less—of the event, or at all events by the commanding
character of the two figures—she could
scarcely call <i>that</i> less either—mainly presented.
Mrs. Lowder and her niece, however dissimilar, had
at least in common that each was a great reality.
That was true, primarily, of the aunt—so true that
Milly wondered how her own companion had arrived,
in other days, at so odd an alliance; yet she
none the less felt Mrs. Lowder as a person of whom
the mind might in two or three days roughly make
the circuit. She would sit there massive, at least,
while one attempted it; whereas Miss Croy, the
handsome girl, would indulge in incalculable movements
that might interfere with one's tour. She
was real, none the less, and everything and everybody
were real; and it served them right, no doubt,
the pair of them, for having rushed into their adventure.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She wondered if the person sitting next to her would understand what she was implying if she were to say it out loud. But, the thing that was really clear to her was that, no, definitely not, he wouldn't. Nevertheless, she now realized that he would probably try to be witty. And in fact, it seemed as if a lot of the excitement would come from the new meaning and impact of both people's cleverness and their simplicity. She felt a thrill, she blushed and then went pale with the certainty – which had never been so clear – that she would be totally caught up in it all. The atmosphere of the place, the nature of the event, had a very specific flavor and a deep underlying tone for her.</i></p><p><i>The smallest things – the faces, the hands, the women's jewelry, the sound of words, especially names, spoken across the table, the shape of the forks, the flower arrangements, the servers’ demeanor, the walls of the room – were all details in a painting and clues in a play. They also showed her how alert she was. She had never, she believed, been in such a heightened state of awareness. Her sensitivity was almost too intense for her comfort. For example, there were more things than she could easily organize in the manner of the friendly niece, who struck her as sophisticated and interesting, in fact, surprisingly warm and friendly. This young woman’s personality had, obviously, other potential directions, but here, she had already established a connection.</i></p><p><i>Were she and Miss Croy going to pick up where their elders had left off so many years ago? Were they going to discover that they liked each other and see if they could make a modern version of a lasting relationship? She had doubted Maud Manningham when they came to England, thinking of her as unreliable and a vague resource. She had seen their reliance on her as a shameful and silly state – if it could be called reliance – if they had wanted to do something as foolish as "get into society." To have made their trip only for the sake of the kind of society Mrs. Lowder might have to offer – that was not even worth considering, and she herself had chosen her path out of curiosity about other things. She would have described this curiosity as a desire to see the places she had read about, and she was prepared to tell her neighbor that, even if it meant he'd see how little she had read.</i></p><p><i>It was almost as if her previous doubts had been challenged by the grandeur – she could hardly call it less – of the event, or at least by the commanding presence of the two main figures – she could hardly call them less either. Mrs. Lowder and her niece, however different, at least had one thing in common: they were both very real. That was especially true of the aunt – so true that Milly wondered how her friend had formed such a strange alliance in the past. Yet she still felt Mrs. Lowder was someone whose mind she could quickly get to know in a few days. She would sit there, imposing at least, while one tried to understand her. Miss Croy, the beautiful girl, would engage in unpredictable actions that could disrupt one's analysis. She was real, nonetheless, and everything and everyone was real. And no doubt, that was good for them, for having jumped into their adventure.</i></p></div>

Lord Mark's intelligence meanwhile, however,
had met her own quite sufficiently to enable him to
tell her how little he could clear up her situation.
He explained, for that matter—or at least he hinted—that
there was no such thing, to-day in London,
as saying where any one was. Every one was
everywhere—nobody was anywhere. He should
be put to it—yes, frankly—to give a name of any
sort or kind to their hostess's "set." <i>Was</i> it a set
at all, or wasn't it, and were there not really no such
things as sets, in the place, any more?—was there
any thing but the senseless shifting tumble, like
that of some great greasy sea in mid-Channel, of
an overwhelming melted mixture? He threw out
the question, which seemed large; Milly felt that
at the end of five minutes he had thrown out a great
many, though he followed none more than a step or
two; perhaps he would prove suggestive, but he
helped her as yet to no discriminations: he spoke
as if he had given them up from too much knowledge.
He was thus at the opposite extreme from
herself, but, as a consequence of it, also wandering
and lost; and he was furthermore, for all his temporary
incoherence, to which she guessed there
would be some key, as great a reality as either Mrs.
Lowder or Kate. The only light in which he
placed the former of these ladies was that of
an extraordinary woman—a most extraordinary
woman, and "the more extraordinary the more one
knows her," while of the latter he said nothing, for
the moment, but that she was tremendously, yes,
quite tremendously, good-looking. It was some
time, she thought, before his talk showed his cleverness,
and yet each minute she believed in it more,
quite apart from what her hostess had told her on
first naming him. Perhaps he was one of the cases
she had heard of at home—those characteristic
cases of people in England who concealed their play
of mind so much more than they showed it. Even
Mr. Densher a little did that. And what made Lord
Mark, at any rate, so real either, when this was a
thing he so definitely insisted on? His type some
how, as by a life, a need, an intention of its own, insisted
<i>for</i> him; but that was all. It was difficult to
guess his age—whether he were a young man who
looked old or an old man who looked young; it
seemed to prove nothing, as against other things,
that he was bald and, as might have been said,
slightly stale, or, more delicately perhaps, dry:
there was such a fine little fidget of preoccupied life
in him, and his eyes, at moments—though it was an
appearance they could suddenly lose—were as candid
and clear as those of a pleasant boy. Very neat,
very light, and so fair that there was little other indication
of his moustache than his constantly feeling
it—which was again boyish—he would have
affected her as the most intellectual person present
if he had not affected her as the most frivolous.
The latter quality was rather in his look than in anything
else, though he constantly wore his double
eyeglass, which was, much more, Bostonian and
thoughtful.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Meanwhile, Lord Mark's intelligence had matched Milly's well enough for him to make it clear that he couldn't clarify her situation much. In fact—or at least, he implied—that in modern London, you couldn't actually pinpoint where anyone was. Everyone was everywhere; nobody was truly anywhere. He’d struggle, frankly, to even define their hostess's social circle. Was it a "set" at all, or not? Were actual social circles even a thing anymore? Was it just a chaotic, ever-shifting mess, like a churning, greasy sea in the middle of the Channel? He posed the question, which seemed significant. Milly felt he'd posed a lot of questions in five minutes, though he didn't follow up on any of them closely. He might be thought-provoking, but he wasn't helping her understand anything yet. He spoke as though he'd given up on understanding things because he knew too much.</i></p><p><i>He was the complete opposite of her, but as a result, he was also lost and uncertain. Despite his temporary incoherence, which she suspected had some meaning, he felt as real as either Mrs. Lowder or Kate. The only way he described Mrs. Lowder was as an extraordinary woman – a most extraordinary woman, and "the more extraordinary, the more you get to know her." He didn't say anything about Kate at that moment, except that she was incredibly, undeniably attractive. Milly thought it took a while for his intelligence to shine through his conversation, yet she believed in it more with each passing minute, regardless of what her hostess had initially told her about him. Perhaps he was one of those people she'd heard about back home – those typical English types who hid their intelligence more than they showed it. Even Mr. Densher did that, a little bit. And what made Lord Mark so real, especially when he insisted on it so strongly? His "type" somehow, as if driven by some internal need and purpose, asserted itself, but that was all. It was hard to guess his age—was he a young man who looked old or an old man who looked young? The fact that he was bald and, perhaps, slightly worn-out or, more delicately, dry, seemed to prove nothing. He had such a subtle, restless energy about him, and his eyes, at times—though it was an appearance they could lose suddenly—were as open and clear as a pleasant boy's. He was very neat, very light-featured, and fair-skinned. His mustache was barely visible, except for the fact that he was constantly touching it, a boyish habit. He would have seemed like the most intellectual person in the room, if he hadn't also seemed like the most frivolous.

The idea of his frivolity had, no doubt, to do with
his personal designation, which represented—as yet,
for our young woman, a little confusedly—a connection
with an historic patriciate, a class that, in
turn, also confusedly, represented an affinity with a
social element that she had never heard otherwise
described than as "fashion." The supreme social
element in New York had never known itself but
as reduced to that category, and though Milly was
aware that, as applied to a territorial and political
aristocracy, the label was probably too simple, she
had for the time none other at hand. She presently,
it is true, enriched her idea with the perception
that her interlocutor was indifferent; yet this, indifferent
as aristocracies notoriously were, saw her but
little further, inasmuch as she felt that, in the first
place, he would much rather get on with her than
not, and in the second was only thinking of too
many matters of his own. If he kept her in view
on the one hand and kept so much else on the other—the
way he crumbed up his bread was a proof—why
did he hover before her as a potentially insolent
noble? She couldn't have answered the question,
and it was precisely one of those that swarmed.
They were complicated, she might fairly have said,
by his visibly knowing, having known from afar off,
that she was a stranger and an American, and by
his none the less making no more of it than if she
and her like were the chief of his diet. He took
her, kindly enough, but imperturbably, irreclaimably,
for granted, and it wouldn't in the least help
that she herself knew him, as quickly, for having
been in her country and threshed it out. There
would be nothing for her to explain or attenuate
or brag about; she could neither escape nor prevail
by her strangeness; he would have, for that matter,
on such a subject, more to tell her than to learn
from her. She might learn from <i>him</i> why she was
so different from the handsome girl—which she
didn't know, being merely able to feel it; or at any
rate might learn from him why the handsome girl
was so different from her.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>His reputation for being frivolous probably stemmed from his title. For Milly, who was still trying to figure things out, that title seemed to connect him to a historical upper class. That class, in turn, also somewhat vaguely, represented a connection to something she only knew as "fashion." New York's elite society only understood itself in those terms. Even though Milly knew that label was probably too simplistic for a hereditary aristocracy, she didn't have a better one at the moment. She soon realized that he seemed indifferent, and although aristocrats were notoriously so, it didn't really help her understand him better. She felt, first, that he actually enjoyed her company, and second, that he was preoccupied with his own thoughts.</i></p><p><i>If he was keeping her in mind, while also dealing with so much else – the way he crumbled his bread was a clue – then why did he present himself as a potentially arrogant nobleman? She couldn't answer that question, and it was just one of many that were swirling around in her mind. They were made more complex, she realized, by the fact that he clearly knew she was a foreigner and an American, but he didn't seem to care any more than if she and people like her were the main focus of his attention. He accepted her, kindly enough, but also with an unwavering, undeniable assumption that she belonged there. And it wouldn't help that she, too, had quickly realized he'd spent time in her country and understood it.</i></p><p><i>There would be nothing for her to explain, downplay, or boast about. She couldn't use her foreignness to escape or gain an advantage. On that topic, he would likely have more to tell her than to learn from her.

On these lines, however, they would move later;
the lines immediately laid down were, in spite of his
vagueness for his own convenience, definite enough.
She was already, he observed to her, thinking what
she should say on her other side—which was what
Americans were always doing. She needn't in conscience
say anything at all; but Americans never
knew that, nor ever, poor creatures, yes (<i>she</i> had
interposed the "poor creatures!") what not to do.
The burdens they took on—the things, positively,
they made an affair of! This easy and, after all,
friendly jibe at her race was really for her, on her
new friend's part, the note of personal recognition
so far as she required it; and she gave him a prompt
and conscious example of morbid anxiety by insisting
that her desire to be, herself, "lovely" all round
was justly founded on the lovely way Mrs. Lowder
had met her. He was directly interested in that,
and it was not till afterwards that she fully knew
how much more information about their friend he
had taken than given. Here again, for instance,
was a pertinent note for her: she had, on the spot,
with her first plunge into the obscure depths of a
society constituted from far back, encountered the
interesting phenomenon of complicated, of possibly
sinister motive. However, Maud Manningham
(her name, even in her presence, somehow still fed
the fancy) <i>had,</i> all the same, been lovely, and one
was going to meet her now quite as far on as one
had one's self been met. She had been with them
at their hotel—they were a pair—before even they
had supposed she could have got their letter. Of
course indeed they had written in advance, but they
had followed that up very fast. She had thus engaged
them to dine but two days later, and on the
morrow again, without waiting for a return visit,
waiting for anything, she had called with her niece.
It was as if she really cared for them, and it was
magnificent fidelity—fidelity to Mrs. Stringham,
her own companion and Mrs. Lowder's former
schoolmate, the lady with the charming face and the
rather high dress down there at the end.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>However, they'd address those points later. The details of the situation that were immediately clear, despite his tendency to be vague when it suited him, were quite specific. He remarked to her that she was already preoccupied with what she should say to the people on the other side of her—a typical American trait, he noted. In truth, she didn't *need* to say anything, but Americans never understood that, nor, unfortunately, did they know what *not* to do (she had interjected "poor things!"). The things they worried about—the things they deliberately made complicated! This good-natured, and ultimately friendly, teasing of her nationality was, for her new friend, a sign of personal connection and acknowledgment, at least as far as she needed it. She promptly and consciously displayed her own tendency toward overthinking by claiming that her desire to be universally "charming" was justified by the welcoming way Mrs. Lowder had greeted her. He was immediately intrigued by that, and it wasn’t until later that she realized how much more information about their friend he had gleaned than he had offered. For example, here was another relevant point for her: upon her initial foray into the murky world of a long-established social circle, she’d encountered the fascinating phenomenon of hidden, possibly suspicious, motives. Still, Maud Manningham (her name, even as she said it, somehow still sparked the imagination) had been lovely, and she was now going to meet her with a similar degree of openness. Maud had been at their hotel with them—they were a pair—before they even expected her to have received their letter. Of course, they had written in advance, but she had followed up very quickly. She had invited them to dinner just two days later, and the very next day, without waiting for them to reciprocate or anything else, she’d called with her niece. It was as if she genuinely cared about them, and it was a magnificent display of loyalty—loyalty to Mrs. Stringham, her own companion and Mrs. Lowder's former school friend, the woman with the charming face and the rather formal dress standing over there at the end.</i></p></div>

It was strange his words should have given her
the sense of his knowing, but it was positive that
they did so, and to the extent of making her believe
them, though still with wonder. That, really, from
this first of their meetings, was what was most to
abide with her: she accepted almost helplessly, she
surrendered to the inevitability of being the sort of
thing, as he might have said, that he at least thoroughly
believed he had, in going about, seen here
enough of for all practical purposes. Her submission
was naturally, moreover, not to be impaired by
her learning later on that he had paid at short intervals,
though at a time apparently just previous to
her own emergence from the obscurity of extreme
youth, three separate visits to New York, where his
nameable friends and his contrasted contacts had
been numerous. His impression, his recollection of
the whole mixed quantity, was still visibly rich. It
had helped him to place her, and she was more and
more sharply conscious of having—as with the door
sharply slammed upon her and the guard's hand
raised in signal to the train—been popped into the
compartment in which she was to travel for him.
It was a use of her that many a girl would have been
doubtless quick to resent; and the kind of mind that
thus, in our young lady, made all for mere seeing and
taking is precisely one of the charms of our subject.
Milly had practically just learned from him, had
made out, as it were, from her rumbling compartment,
that he gave her the highest place among their
friend's actual properties. She was a success, that
was what it came to, he presently assured her, and
that was what it was to be a success: it always happened
before one could know it. One's ignorance
was in fact often the greatest part of it. "You
haven't had time yet," he said; "this is nothing.
But you'll see. You'll see everything. You can,
you know—everything you dream of."

Her acceptance wouldn't be diminished by her later finding out that he had, at short intervals, though apparently just before she emerged from her extreme youth, made three trips to New York, where he had many friends and acquaintances with different backgrounds. His impression, his memory of this whole varied group, was still clearly vivid. It had helped him figure her out, and she was increasingly aware of being—like a door slammed shut on her and the guard signaling the train—thrust into the situation in which she was going to be involved with him. Many a girl would likely be quick to resent being used like that; and the kind of mind that, in our young lady, was entirely receptive and passive is precisely one of the things that makes her interesting.

He made her more and more wonder; she almost
felt as if he were showing her visions while he spoke;
and strangely enough, though it was visions that had
drawn her on, she hadn't seen them in connection—that
is in such preliminary and necessary connection—with
such a face as Lord Mark's, such eyes and
such a voice, such a tone and such a manner. He
had for an instant the effect of making her ask herself
if she were after all going to be afraid; so distinct
was it for fifty seconds that a fear passed over
her. There they were again—yes, certainly: Susie's
overture to Mrs. Lowder had been their joke, but
they had pressed in that gaiety an electric bell that
continued to sound. Positively, while she sat there,
she had the loud rattle in her ears, and she wondered,
during these moments, why the others didn't hear it.
They didn't stare, they didn't smile, and the fear in
her that I speak of was but her own desire to stop it.
That dropped, however, as if the alarm itself had
ceased; she seemed to have seen in a quick, though
tempered glare that there were two courses for her,
one to leave London again the first thing in the morning,
the other to do nothing at all. Well, she would
do nothing at all; she was already doing it; more
than that, she had already done it, and her chance
was gone. She gave herself up—she had the
strangest sense, on the spot, of so deciding; for she
had turned a corner before she went on again with
Lord Mark. Inexpressive, but intensely significant,
he met as no one else could have done the very question
she had suddenly put to Mrs. Stringham on the
Brünig. Should she have it, whatever she did have,
that question had been, for long? "Ah, so possibly
not," her neighbour appeared to reply; "therefore,
don't you see? <i>I'm</i> the way." It was vivid that he
might be, in spite of his absence of flourish; the way
being doubtless just <i>in</i> that absence. The handsome
girl, whom she didn't lose sight of and who, she felt,
kept her also in view—Mrs. Lowder's striking niece
would, perhaps, be the way as well, for in her too
was the absence of flourish, though she had little else,
so far as one could tell, in common with Lord Mark.
Yet how indeed <i>could</i> one tell, what did one understand,
and of what was one, for that matter, provisionally
conscious but of their being somehow together
in what they represented? Kate Croy, fine
but friendly, looked over at her as really with a guess
at Lord Mark's effect on her. If she could guess
this effect what then did she know about it and in
what degree had she felt it herself? Did that represent,
as between them, anything particular, and
should she have to count with them as duplicating,
as intensifying by a mutual intelligence, the relation
into which she was sinking? Nothing was so odd
as that she should have to recognise so quickly in
each of these glimpses of an instant the various signs
of a relation; and this anomaly itself, had she had
more time to give to it, might well, might almost terribly
have suggested to her that her doom was to live
fast. It was queerly a question of the short run and
the consciousness proportionately crowded.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>He made her increasingly curious. She almost felt as though he was showing her visions as he spoke. Strangely enough, even though visions had drawn her in, she hadn't seen them connected—specifically, in such a crucial and necessary way—with a face like Lord Mark's, or with his eyes, voice, tone, and manner. For a moment, he made her wonder if she was going to be afraid; so distinct was the feeling, even if only for a short time, that fear washed over her. There they were again – yes, definitely: Susie's introduction to Mrs. Lowder had been their inside joke, but in that moment of levity, they had triggered an alarm bell that continued to ring. Honestly, as she sat there, she heard the loud ringing in her ears, and she wondered why the others didn’t hear it. They didn't stare, they didn't smile, and the fear I'm describing was only her own desire to make it stop. That fear, however, vanished, as if the alarm itself had ceased. She seemed to have realized in a flash of understanding that she had two options: leave London first thing in the morning, or do absolutely nothing. Well, she would do nothing; she was already doing it. More than that, she had already done it, and her opportunity was gone. She gave up – she had the strange feeling that she'd made that decision in that moment, because she'd changed her mind before she continued talking with Lord Mark. His expression was blank, but his impact was intense; he understood the very question she'd suddenly asked Mrs. Stringham on the Brünig. Should she have it, whatever she had – that had been the question for a long time. "Ah, maybe not," her neighbor seemed to reply. "Therefore, don't you see? I'm the way." It was clear that he might be, even without trying to be; the way, undoubtedly, was in that lack of effort. The beautiful girl whom she didn't take her eyes off of, and who, she felt, was also watching her—Mrs. Lowder's striking niece—might also be the way, because she too lacked effort, though, as far as one could tell, she had little else in common with Lord Mark. Yet, how could one know? What did one understand? What was she, for that matter, tentatively aware of, except for the fact that they were somehow connected in what they represented? Kate Croy, elegant but approachable, looked over at her as though she could guess the effect Lord Mark had on her. If she could guess that effect, then what did she know about it, and to what extent had she felt it herself? Did that represent anything specific between them, and should she have to consider them as duplicating and intensifying their shared understanding of the situation she was getting involved in? It was so odd that she had to recognize so quickly the various signs of their connection in each of these brief moments. This very strangeness, if she'd had more time to think about it, might have suggested to her—almost frighteningly—that her fate was to live life quickly. It was a strange question of the short term and a correspondingly compressed consciousness.</i></p></div>

These were immense excursions for the spirit of
a young person at Mrs. Lowder's mere dinner-party;
but what was so significant and so admonitory as the
fact of their being possible? What could they have
been but just a part, already, of the crowded consciousness?
And it was just a part, likewise, that
while plates were changed and dishes presented and
periods in the banquet marked; while appearances
insisted and phenomena multiplied and words
reached her from here and there like plashes of a
slow, thick tide; while Mrs. Lowder grew somehow
more stout and more instituted and Susie, at her
distance and in comparison, more thinly improvised
and more different—different, that is, from every
one and everything: it was just a part that while
this process went forward our young lady alighted,
came back, taking up her destiny again as if she had
been able by a wave or two of her wings to place
herself briefly in sight of an alternative to it. Whatever
it was it had showed in this brief interval as
better than the alternative; and it now presented itself
altogether in the image and in the place in which
she had left it. The image was that of her being,
as Lord Mark had declared, a success. This depended
more or less of course on his idea of the thing—into
which at present, however, she wouldn't go.
But, renewing soon, she had asked him what he
meant then that Mrs. Lowder would do with her,
and he had replied that this might safely be left.
"She'll get back," he pleasantly said, "her money."
He could say it too—which was singular—without
affecting her either as vulgar or as "nasty "; and
he had soon explained himself by adding: "Nobody
here, you know, does anything for nothing."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>These dinner parties at Mrs. Lowder's were incredibly stimulating for a young person. But what was so striking and insightful was the fact that these experiences were even happening. They were already becoming part of her complex thoughts and feelings. And it was also true that as plates were replaced, food served, and the meal progressed; as social expectations and situations became more complex, and conversation flowed around her; as Mrs. Lowder became increasingly imposing and established, and Susie, in comparison, seemed less prepared and more distinct – different from everyone and everything; it was also true that during this process, our young lady momentarily escaped, retreated, and then returned, taking up her life again as if she'd briefly glimpsed an alternative future. Whatever that alternative was, it had, for a brief moment, seemed better than her current reality. And now, it presented itself in the same form and place she had left it. This alternative was the idea that, as Lord Mark had said, she was a success. This, of course, depended on his definition of success, which she didn't want to think about right now.</i></p><p><i>But, later, she'd asked him what Mrs. Lowder would do with her, and he'd replied that it was best to leave that to Mrs. Lowder.

She neglected his question for a little, partly because
her attention attached itself more and more to
the handsome girl, partly because, placed so near
their hostess, she wished not to show as discussing
her too freely. Mrs. Lowder, it was true, steering
in the other quarter a course in which she called at
subjects as if they were islets in an archipelago, continued
to allow them their ease, and Kate Croy, at
the same time, steadily revealed herself as interesting.
Milly in fact found, of a sudden, her ease—found
it all—as she bethought herself that what Mrs.
Lowder was really arranging for was a report on
her quality and, as perhaps might be said, her value
from Lord Mark. She wished him, the wonderful
lady, to have no pretext for not knowing what he
thought of Miss Theale. Why his judgment so
mattered remained to be seen; but it was this divination,
in any case, that now determined Milly's rejoinder.
"No. She knows you. She has probably
reason to. And you all, here, know each other—I
see that—so far as you know anything. You
know what you're used to, and it's your being used

She wanted the wonderful Mrs. Lowder to have no excuse for not knowing what he thought of Miss Theale. Why his opinion was so important was still unclear, but this realization determined Milly's response. "No. She knows you. She probably has a reason to.

If it established thus that they couldn't, or
Wouldn't, mix, why, none the less, did Milly feel,

which she had been, in spite of herself, appointed?

<p>
What queerer consequence of their not mixing than
their talking—for it was what they had arrived at—almost
intimately? She wished to get away from
him, or indeed, much rather, away from herself so
far as she was present to him. She saw already—wonderful
creature, after all, herself too—that there
would be a good deal more of him to come for her,
and that the special sign of their intercourse would
be to keep herself out of the question. Everything
else might come in—only never that; and with such
an arrangement they might even go far. This in
fact might quite have begun, on the spot, with her
returning again to the topic of the handsome girl.
If she was to keep herself out she could naturally best
do so by putting in somebody else. She accordingly
put in Kate Croy, being ready to that extent—as she
was not at all afraid for her—to sacrifice her if necessary.
Lord Mark himself, for that matter, had
made it easy by saying a little while before that no
one among them did anything for nothing. "What
then"—she was aware of being abrupt—"does
Miss Croy, if she's so interested, do it for? What
has she to gain by <i>her</i> lovely welcome? Look at
her <i>now!"</i> Milly broke out with characteristic
freedom of praise, though pulling herself up also
with a compunctious "Oh!" as the direction thus
given to their eyes happened to coincide with a turn
of Kate's face to them. All she had meant to do
was to insist that this face was fine; but what she
had in fact done was to renew again her effect of
showing herself to its possessor as conjoined with
Lord Mark for some interested view of it. He had,
however, promptly met her question.

"So then," she said abruptly, "what does Miss Croy, if she's so interested, get out of it? What's her reason for being so welcoming? Look at her now!" Milly gushed with her usual enthusiasm, though she also stopped herself with a quick "Oh!" because the direction of their gaze happened to coincide with Kate turning her head towards them. All she'd meant to do was to emphasize that Kate's face was beautiful, but what she'd actually done was reinforce the impression that she and Lord Mark were somehow connected and looking at Kate with some ulterior motive.

"No—I've failed with her. It's no use. I don't
make her out. And I assure you I really should like
to." His assurance had in fact for his companion a
positive suggestion of sincerity; he affected her as
now saying something that he felt; and she was the
more struck with it as she was still conscious of the
failure even of curiosity he had just shown in respect
to herself. She had meant something—though indeed
for herself almost only—in speaking of their
friend's natural pity; it had been a note, doubtless, of
questionable taste, but it had quavered out in spite of
her; and he had not so much as cared to inquire
"Why 'natural'?" Not that it wasn't really much
better for her that he shouldn't: explanations would
in truth have taken her much too far. Only she now
perceived that, in comparison, her word about this
other person really "drew" him; and there were
things in that, probably, many things, as to which
she would learn more and which glimmered there
already as part and parcel of that larger "real" with
which, in her new situation, she was to be beguiled.
It was in fact at the very moment, this element, not
absent from what Lord Mark was further saying.
"So you're wrong, you see, as to our knowing all
about each other. There are cases where we break
down. I at any rate give <i>her</i> up—up, that is, to you.
You must do her for me—tell me, I mean, when you
know more. You'll notice," he pleasantly wound
up, "that I've confidence in you."

His sincerity was actually quite convincing to her companion; he seemed to be saying something genuine, and she was more affected by it because she was still aware of the lack of even curiosity he had just shown about her. She had intended something—though mostly for herself—when she mentioned their friend's natural compassion; it was probably a bit tactless, but it had slipped out anyway, and he hadn't even bothered to ask "Why 'natural'?" Not that it was necessarily bad for her that he didn't: explaining would have been too complicated. But she realized that her comment about this other person actually interested him; and there were things in that, probably many things, that she'd learn more about, and which were already hinting at the bigger "reality" that was supposed to consume her in her new situation. In fact, that very element was present even as Lord Mark continued speaking.</i></p><p><i>"So you're mistaken, you see, about us knowing everything about each other. There are situations where we fail. I'm giving up on her—handing her over to you. You have to figure her out for me—tell me, I mean, when you know more.

"Why shouldn't you have?" Milly asked, observing
in this, as she thought, a fine, though, for such
a man, a surprisingly artless, fatuity. It was as if
there might have been a question of her falsifying
for the sake of her own show—that is of her honesty
not being proof against her desire to keep well with
him herself. She didn't, none the less, otherwise
protest against his remark; there was something else
she was occupied in seeing. It was the handsome
girl alone, one of his own species and his own society,
who had made him feel uncertain; of his certainties
about a mere little American, a cheap exotic, imported
almost wholesale, and whose habitat, with its
conditions of climate, growth, and cultivation, its
immense profusion, but its few varieties and thin
development, he was perfectly satisfied. The marvel
was, too, that Milly understood his satisfaction—feeling
that she expressed the truth in presently
saying: "Of course; I make out that she must be
difficult; just as I see that I myself must be easy."
And that was what, for all the rest of this occasion,
remained with her—as the most interesting thing
that could remain. She was more and more content
herself to be easy; she would have been resigned,
even had it been brought straighter home to her, to
passing for a cheap exotic. Provisionally, at any
rate, that protected her wish to keep herself, with
Lord Mark, in abeyance. They <i>had</i> all affected her
as inevitably knowing each other, and if the handsome
girl's place among them was something even
their initiation couldn't deal with—why, then, she
would indeed be a quantity.

<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Why wouldn't you?" Milly asked, noticing what she considered a naive, almost shockingly simple, self-deception in him, especially for someone like him. It was as if he suspected she might be pretending, just to make a good impression – that her honesty might not be strong enough to overcome her desire to stay on his good side. But she didn't object to his comment; she was focused on something else. She was looking at the beautiful woman, one of his own kind and from his social circle, who had made him feel insecure. He had been so sure about a little American like her—a cheap, foreign import, almost mass-produced, whose background, with its specific environment, upbringing, and limited development, he fully understood. The surprising thing was that Milly understood his satisfaction, and she expressed the truth when she said, "Of course. I can see she must be challenging, just as I can see I must be easygoing." And that statement stayed with her for the rest of their conversation, as the most interesting thing to come from it. She was increasingly happy to be easygoing. She would have accepted, even if it had been made clearer, being seen as a cheap exotic. For the time being, at least, that allowed her to postpone any further involvement with Lord Mark. They all seemed to know each other intimately, and if the beautiful woman's place among them was something they couldn't even explain—well, then, she would be a valuable and significant person.</i></p></div>

<p>For a week following a dinner, an American pair, Milly Theale and her companion Mrs. Stringham (Susan Shepherd), are in London. Milly and Mrs. Stringham frequently remark to each other that they have only themselves to thank. Mrs. Stringham is pleased because an appeal she made to her old schoolmate, Mrs. Lowder (Maud Manningham), was met positively.</p><p>During this week, the two elder women, Mrs. Stringham and Mrs. Lowder, spend time together. Mrs. Stringham tells Mrs. Lowder about Milly, and Mrs. Lowder tells Mrs. Stringham about her niece, Kate Croy.</p><p>At the same time, Milly and Kate Croy become friends and spend their days together. They explore London's shops, streets, suburbs, museums, and monuments. Milly gives Mrs. Stringham accounts of her time with Kate. She tells Mrs. Stringham she thinks Kate has a secret trouble and is using their friendship as a diversion.</p><p>Kate tells Milly about her family situation. In turn, Milly tells Kate about her American background, her family's financial history, and her deceased relatives. Each tells the other she finds her more remarkable than herself.</p><p>During their outings, Milly gives Kate several presents, including precious ornaments. Kate tells Milly she must avoid shops unless Milly promises not to buy things for her.</p><p>By the end of the week, Milly asks Kate for information about Lord Mark and to be promised a visit to Kate's sister, Mrs. Condrip. Kate explains that Lord Mark's value is based on his future potential, which her aunt believes in. She says he was briefly in Parliament but lost his seat. Kate also explains to Milly that in London society, relationships are like bargains where everyone gives something to get something in return. She says that both she and Milly have been "taken up" by Mrs. Lowder.</p><p>In another conversation, Milly observes to Kate that she is surprised Mrs. Lowder is not bored by Mrs. Stringham. Kate agrees, and Milly sees that Kate finds Mrs. Stringham uninteresting.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** An immensely wealthy, curious, and imaginative American, Milly is initially presented as a "slightly gasping" newcomer, likened to a "wandering princess." She perceives the world through a romantic and literary lens, immediately casting Kate as a "heroine." She is perceptive, guessing Kate has a secret trouble, yet naive about social dangers. She is extremely generous and possesses a freedom from financial anxiety that Kate finds remarkable.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** She moves from being a passive observer "caught up by a wave" to an active and engaged participant in London life. Her initial awe shifts to a deep fascination, and she quickly forms an intense friendship with Kate, even beginning to see her own powerful status through Kate’s eyes.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Stringham (Susan "Susie" Shepherd)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Milly’s older companion, a "pilgrim from Boston." She is analytical and values understanding the reasons behind actions. She is initially in a state of "exaltation" that her social faith in Mrs. Lowder has been justified. This gives way to a feeling of being "carried away" by the "vast, obscure, lurid" London world, which gives her a "bad conscience."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts from one of simple, triumphant success to a more complex state of being both fascinated and morally unnerved by her new environment. She is simultaneously thrilled for Milly and overwhelmed herself.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** A "handsome English girl," she is presented as pragmatic, worldly, and observant. Milly sees her as the archetype of the "wondrous London girl," but Kate sees herself as part of a transactional social system where people are either "working" or "being worked." She has an unspoken "smothered trouble." She is described as having a defensive "brutality" and a quickness to judge what she will not like.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Initially positioned as a guide for Milly, Kate quickly becomes an intimate friend and a powerful influence. She shifts from being an object of Milly’s romantic imagination to an active force who provides a cynical but frank education in the ways of her world.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Maud Manningham)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** A formidable and powerful London hostess. She is described as "large" not because she is empty but because she is "full," like a "projectile... loaded and ready for use." She is a woman of action who operates on instinct rather than articulated reasons. She is a social force who "takes people up" and in whom others, like Kate, place their belief.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her primary shift occurred just before this text begins by unexpectedly and graciously welcoming her old American friends. Within the passage, she is a stable center of power, actively managing her social circle and setting events in motion for the other characters.</li></ul>

That sense of quantities, separate or mixed, was
indeed doubtless what most prevailed at first for our
slightly gasping American pair; it found utterance
for them in their frequent remark to each other that
they had no one but themselves to thank. It dropped
from Milly more than once that if she had ever
known it was so easy—! though her exclamation
mostly ended without completing her idea. This,
however, was a trifle to Mrs. Stringham, who cared
little whether she meant that in this case she would
have come sooner. She couldn't have come sooner,
and she perhaps, on the contrary, meant—for it
would have been like her—that she wouldn't have
come at all; why it was so easy being at any rate
a matter as to which her companion had begun
quickly to pick up views. Susie kept some of these
lights for the present to herself, since, freely communicated,
they might have been a little disturbing;
with which, moreover, the quantities that we speak
of as surrounding the two ladies were, in many cases,
quantities of things—and of other things—to talk
about. Their immediate lesson, accordingly, was
that they just had been caught up by the incalculable
strength of a wave that was actually holding them
aloft and that would naturally dash them wherever
it liked. They meanwhile, we hasten to add, make
the best of their precarious position, and if Milly had
had no other help for it she would have found not
a little in the sight of Susan Shepherd's state. The
girl had had nothing to say to her, for three days,
about the "success" announced by Lord Mark—which
they saw, besides, otherwise established; she
was too taken up, too touched, by Susie's own exaltation.
Susie glowed in the light of her justified
faith; everything had happened that she had been
acute enough to think least probable; she had appealed
to a possible delicacy in Maud Manningham—a
delicacy, mind you, but <i>barely</i> possible—and her
appeal had been met in a way that was an honour to
human nature. This proved sensibility of the lady
of Lancaster Gate performed verily, for both our
friends, during these first days, the office of a fine
floating gold-dust, something that threw over the
prospect a harmonising blur. The forms, the colours
behind it were strong and deep—we have seen how
they already stood out for Milly; but nothing, comparatively,
had had so much of the dignity of truth
as the fact of Maud's fidelity to a sentiment. That
was what Susie was proud of, much more than of
her great place in the world, which she was moreover
conscious of not as yet wholly measuring. That
was what was more vivid even than her being—in
senses more worldly and in fact almost in the degree
of a revelation—English and distinct and positive,
with almost no inward, but with the finest outward
resonance.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The understanding of quantities, whether separate or combined, was undoubtedly the initial focus for our slightly bewildered American pair. They frequently remarked to each other that they were entirely responsible for their situation. Milly often mentioned that if she'd known it would be this easy—! though she rarely finished the thought. However, this didn't bother Mrs. Stringham, who didn't care whether Milly meant she would have come sooner. She couldn't have come sooner, and perhaps, on the contrary, she meant—as was typical of her—that she wouldn't have come at all. The ease of the situation was a concept Milly was quickly grasping. Susie kept some of her insights to herself for the time being, as sharing them freely might have been unsettling. Besides, the "quantities" surrounding the two women were, in many cases, things—and other things—to discuss. Their immediate lesson was that they'd been swept up by the overwhelming power of a wave, which was lifting them up and would naturally carry them wherever it chose. Meanwhile, they made the best of their precarious situation, and if Milly had nothing else to rely on, she would have found solace in observing Susan Shepherd's state. Susie hadn't mentioned Lord Mark's announced "success" for three days—which they also knew had been accomplished in other ways. She was too preoccupied and moved by Susie's own elation. Susie radiated with the joy of her confirmed beliefs; everything had happened that she'd thought least likely. She'd appealed to a possible sense of decency in Maud Manningham—a barely possible decency, mind you—and her appeal had been answered in a way that honored human nature. This demonstrated sensitivity from the woman of Lancaster Gate acted, for both friends, like a fine, floating gold dust during those first few days, softening the overall view with a harmonious blur. The shapes and colors behind it were strong and deep—as we've seen they already were for Milly; but nothing, in comparison, possessed as much the dignity of truth as Maud's loyalty to a feeling. That was what Susie was proud of, more than her high social standing, which she was still getting used to. That was more vivid even than her being—in a more worldly sense and to a degree that felt almost like a revelation—English and distinct and confident, with little introspection but the finest outward charm.</i></p></div>

Susan Shepherd's word for her, again and again,
was that she was "large"; yet it was not exactly a
case, as to the soul, of echoing chambers: she might
have been likened rather to a capacious receptacle,
originally perhaps loose, but now drawn as tightly
as possible over its accumulated contents—a packed
mass, for her American admirer, of curious detail.
When the latter good lady, at home, had handsomely
figured her friends as not small—which was the way
she mostly figured them—there was a certain implication
that they were spacious because they were
empty. Mrs. Lowder, by a different law, was spacious
because she was full, because she had something
in common, even in repose, with a projectile,
of great size, loaded and ready for use. That indeed,
to Susie's romantic mind, announced itself as
half the charm of their renewal—a charm as of sitting
in springtime, during a long peace, on the
daisied, grassy bank of some great slumbering fortress.
True to her psychological instincts, certainly,
Mrs. Stringham had noted that the "sentiment"
she rejoiced in on her old schoolmate's part was all
a matter of action and movement, was not, save for
the interweaving of a more frequent plump "dearest"
than she would herself perhaps have used, a
matter of much other embroidery. She brooded,
with interest, on this further remark of race, feeling
in her own spirit a different economy. The joy, for
her, was to know <i>why</i> she acted—the reason was
half the business; whereas with Mrs. Lowder there
might have been no reason: "why" was the trivial
seasoning-substance, the vanilla or the nutmeg, omittable
from the nutritive pudding without spoiling it.
Mrs. Lowder's desire was clearly sharp that their
young companions should also prosper together;
and Mrs. Stringham's account of it all to Milly, during
the first days, was that when, at Lancaster Gate,
she was not occupied in telling, as it were, about her,
she was occupied in hearing much of the history of
her hostess's brilliant niece.

When that nice American woman would describe her friends as "not small" (which was her usual way of putting it), she implied they were spacious because they were empty. Mrs. Lowder, however, was spacious because she was full. She had something inside, even when she was still, like a massive, loaded projectile, ready to be launched.

It wasn't about flowery language, except for the frequent use of "dearest," a term she herself wouldn't use as often.

They had plenty, on these lines, the two elder
women, to give and to take, and it was even not quite
clear to the pilgrim from Boston that what she
should mainly have arranged for in London was not
a series of thrills for herself. She had a bad conscience,
indeed almost a sense of immorality, in having
to recognise that she was, as she said, carried
away. She laughed to Milly when she also said that
she didn't know where it would end; and the principal
of her uneasiness was that Mrs. Lowder's life
bristled for her with elements that she was really
having to look at for the first time. They represented,
she believed, the world, the world that, as a consequence
of the cold shoulder turned to it by the
Pilgrim Fathers, had never yet boldly crossed to Boston—it
would surely have sunk the stoutest Cunarder—and
she couldn't pretend that she faced the
prospect simply because Milly had had a caprice.
She was in the act herself of having one, directed
precisely to their present spectacle. She could but
seek strength in the thought that she had never had
one—or had never yielded to one, which came to the
same thing—before. The sustaining sense of it all,
moreover, as literary material—that quite dropped
from her. She must wait, at any rate, she should
see: it struck her, so far as she had got, as vast, obscure,
lurid. She reflected in the watches of the
night that she was probably just going to love it for
itself—that is for itself and Milly. The odd thing
was that she could think of Milly's loving it without
dread—or with dread, at least not on the score of
conscience, only on the score of peace. It was a
mercy, at all events, for the hour, that their fancies
jumped together.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The two older women had lots to talk about and discuss, and the visitor from Boston wasn't even sure that the main thing she should have been doing in London wasn't just chasing exciting experiences for herself. She felt guilty, almost like she was doing something wrong, admitting that she was, as she put it, getting swept away. She laughed to Milly when she also said she didn't know where it would lead. Her main worry was that Mrs. Lowder's life was filled with things she was really seeing for the first time. She thought these things represented the world, the world that, because the Pilgrim Fathers had rejected it, had never boldly gone to Boston—it would probably sink the biggest ship—and she couldn't pretend that she was facing this situation just because Milly had a whim. She was having a whim of her own, specifically directed at what they were experiencing. She could only find comfort in the idea that she had never had a whim—or had never given in to one, which amounted to the same thing—before. The idea that all this could be used as material for writing—that completely disappeared. She had to wait, anyway, and she would see: it seemed to her, at this stage, vast, unclear, and shocking. She realized during the night that she was probably going to love it just for what it was—that is, for itself and for Milly. The strange thing was that she could imagine Milly loving it without fear—or with fear, but not because she felt guilty, only because she worried about their peace of mind. It was a good thing, for now at least, that their imaginations were running in the same direction.</i></p></div>

While, for this first week that followed their dinner,
she drank deep at Lancaster Gate, her companion
was no less happily, appeared to be indeed on the
whole quite as romantically, provided for. The
handsome English girl from the heavy English house
had been as a figure in a picture stepping by magic
out of its frame: it was a case, in truth, for which
Mrs. Stringham presently found the perfect image.
She had lost none of her grasp, but quite the contrary,
of that other conceit in virtue of which Milly
was the wandering princess: so what could be more
in harmony now than to see the princess waited upon
at the city gate by the worthiest maiden, the chosen
daughter of the burgesses? It was the real again,
evidently, the amusement of the meeting for the
princess too; princesses living for the most part, in
such an appeased way, on the plane of mere elegant
representation. That was why they pounced, at city
gates, on deputed flower-strewing damsels; that was
why, after effigies, processions, and other stately
games, frank human company was pleasant to them.
Kate Croy really presented herself to Milly—the latter
abounded for Mrs. Stringham in accounts of it—as
the wondrous London girl in person, by what
she had conceived, from far back, of the London
girl; conceived from the tales of travellers and the
anecdotes of New York, from old porings over
<i>Punch</i> and a liberal acquaintance with the fiction of
the day. The only thing was that she was nicer,
for the creature in question had rather been, to our
young woman, an image of dread. She had thought
of her, at her best, as handsome just as Kate was,
with turns of head and tones of voice, felicities of
stature and attitude, things "put on" and, for that
matter, put off, all the marks of the product of a
packed society who should be at the same time the
heroine of a strong story. She placed this striking
young person from the first in a story, saw her, by a
necessity of the imagination, for a heroine, felt it the
only character in which she wouldn't be wasted; and
this in spite of the heroine's pleasant abruptness, her
forbearance from gush, her umbrellas and jackets
and shoes—as these things sketched themselves to
Milly—and something rather of a breezy boy in the
carriage of her arms and the occasional freedom of
her slang.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>For the week after their dinner, while Milly was enjoying herself at Lancaster Gate, her friend seemed equally happy, maybe even more romantically content. The beautiful English woman from the wealthy English family was like a character stepping out of a painting; Mrs. Stringham found the perfect metaphor for it. Milly still held onto the idea of being a wandering princess, so it was fitting to see her met at the city gate by the most deserving woman, the chosen daughter of the townspeople. It was reality again, obviously, and amusing for the princess as well, since princesses usually lived in a world of formal appearances. That’s why they loved meeting the flower-bearing girls at city gates, and why they enjoyed genuine company after the ceremonies and displays.</i></p><p><i>Kate Croy genuinely came across to Milly—as Mrs. Stringham heard repeatedly—as the amazing "London girl" in the flesh, a person based on what Milly had imagined from her early days: the London girl she’d read about in travelers’ stories and New York anecdotes, from old issues of Punch magazine, and a good understanding of contemporary fiction. The only difference was that Kate was even nicer. Milly had previously pictured her as intimidating, at best, beautiful like Kate, with a similar way of turning her head and speaking, a similar posture, a look that was both deliberate and easily discarded; all the hallmarks of a product of high society who should be the heroine of a powerful story. Milly immediately saw this striking young woman as a character in a story, a heroine by necessity, the only role where she wouldn’t be wasted. This was despite the heroine's friendly directness, her lack of emotional outbursts, and the practical clothes she wore—umbrellas, jackets, shoes—as Milly imagined them, and the slightly tomboyish way she carried herself and the occasional use of slang.</i></p></div>

When Milly had settled that the extent of her
goodwill itself made her shy, she had found for the
moment quite a sufficient key, and they were by that
time thoroughly afloat together. This might well
have been the happiest hour they were to know, attacking
in friendly independence their great London—the
London of shops and streets and suburbs oddly
interesting to Milly, as well as of museums, monuments,
"sights" oddly unfamiliar to Kate, while
their elders pursued a separate course, both rejoicing
in their intimacy and each thinking the other's young
woman a great acquisition for her own. Milly expressed
to Susan Shepherd more than once that Kate
had some secret, some smothered trouble, besides all
the rest of her history; and that if she had so good-naturedly
helped Mrs. Lowder to meet them this was
exactly to create a diversion, to give herself something
else to think about. But on the case thus postulated
our young American had as yet had no light:
she only felt that when the light should come it
would greatly deepen the colour; and she liked to
think she was prepared for anything. What she
already knew, moreover, was full to her vision, of
English, of eccentric, of Thackerayan character,
Kate Croy having gradually become not a little explicit
on the subject of her situation, her past, her
present, her general predicament, her small success,
up to the present hour, in contenting at the same time
her father, her sister, her aunt and herself. It was
Milly's subtle guess, imparted to her Susie, that the
girl had somebody else as well, as yet unnamed, to
content, it being manifest that such a creature
couldn't help having; a creature not perhaps, if one
would, exactly formed to inspire passions, since that
always implied a certain silliness, but essentially
seen, by the admiring eye of friendship, under the
clear shadow of some probably eminent male interest.
The clear shadow, from whatever source projected,
hung, at any rate, over Milly's companion the whole
week, and Kate Croy's handsome face smiled out of
it, under bland skylights, in the presence alike of old
masters passive in their glory and of thoroughly new
ones, the newest, who bristled restlessly with pins
and brandished snipping shears.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly, having decided that her own friendly nature made her shy, had found a way to connect with Kate, and they were really enjoying each other's company. This might have been the best time they ever had together, exploring London on their own – the London of stores, streets, and suburbs that Milly found fascinating, and the museums, monuments, and "sights" that were new to Kate. Meanwhile, their parents were occupied elsewhere, both happy about the girls' friendship, each thinking the other's daughter was a wonderful friend. Milly told Susan Shepherd more than once that Kate was hiding something, some kind of hidden worry, on top of everything else she'd been through. She thought that if Kate had helped Mrs. Lowder meet them, it was just to distract herself, to give herself something else to focus on. But Milly, as a young American, didn't know the full story yet. She just felt that when the truth came out, it would be much more complicated than she thought. And she liked to believe she was ready for anything. What she *did* know was that Kate Croy's situation was full of the kind of English, quirky, and slightly old-fashioned things you'd find in a novel. Kate had slowly told Milly about her life, her past, her current problems, her general difficult situation, and how little she'd succeeded in pleasing her father, her sister, her aunt, and herself up to that point. Milly subtly guessed, and told her friend Susie, that Kate also had someone else to please, someone she hadn't mentioned yet. It was obvious that someone like Kate would have someone like that; someone who perhaps wasn't meant to inspire passionate love, since that always seemed a bit silly, but who was clearly very important, likely a prominent man, from the perspective of their friendship. That sense of something important in the background, no matter where it came from, hung over Milly's friend all week. Kate Croy's attractive face smiled out from under the soft light of the city, in the company of both classic, respected paintings and the newest artists, who were bustling with activity and wielding scissors.</i></p></div>

It was meanwhile a pretty part of the intercourse
of these young ladies that each thought the other
more remarkable than herself—that each thought
herself, or assured the other she did, a comparatively
dusty object and the other a favourite of nature and
of fortune. Kate was amused, amazed at the way
her friend insisted on "taking" her, and Milly wondered
if Kate were sincere in finding her the most
extraordinary—quite apart from her being the most
charming—person she had come across. They had
talked, in long drives, and quantities of history had
not been wanting—in the light of which Mrs. Lowder's
niece might superficially seem to have had the
best of the argument. Her visitor's American references,
with their bewildering immensities, their confounding
moneyed New York, their excitements of
high pressure, their opportunities of wild freedom,
their record of used-up relatives, parents, clever,
eager, fair, slim brothers—these the most loved—all
engaged, as well as successive superseded guardians,
in a high extravagance of speculation and dissipation
that had left this exquisite being her black dress, her
white face and her vivid hair as the mere last broken
link: such a picture quite threw into the shade
the brief biography, however sketchily amplified,
of a mere middle-class nobody in Bayswater. And
though that indeed might be but a Bayswater way
of putting it, in addition to which Milly was in the
stage of interest in Bayswater ways, this critic so
far prevailed that, like Mrs. Stringham herself, she
fairly got her companion to accept from her that
she was quite the nearest approach to a practical
princess Bayswater could hope ever to know. It
was a fact—it became one at the end of three days—that
Milly actually began to borrow from the handsome
girl a sort of view of her state; the handsome
girl's impression of it was clearly so sincere. This
impression was a tribute, a tribute positively to
power, power the source of which was the last thing
Kate treated as a mystery. There were passages,
under all their skylights, the succession of their shops
being large, in which the latter's easy, yet the least
bit dry manner sufficiently gave out that if she had
had so deep a pocket——!

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The interesting thing about their friendship was that each of these young women thought the other was more extraordinary than herself. Each one considered herself, or pretended to consider herself, rather ordinary, while she believed the other was favored by both nature and good luck. Kate was amused and surprised by how her friend insisted on admiring her, and Milly wondered if Kate was sincere in thinking her the most fascinating person she’d ever met, aside from being the most charming. They had talked during long drives, and they’d discussed a lot of history—in light of which, Mrs. Lowder’s niece might have superficially seemed to have the upper hand in their discussions. Kate's American background, with its overwhelming scale, its bewilderingly wealthy New York, its fast-paced excitement, its freedom, and its history of relatives who had been exhausted—parents, clever, enthusiastic, attractive, slim brothers (who were most beloved)—all of whom were involved, along with a string of replaced guardians, in an extravagant lifestyle of risky investments and overindulgence. This picture left Kate with just her black dress, her pale face, and her striking hair as the only remaining evidence of her past. This kind of background completely overshadowed the short, even if well-detailed, biography of an average middle-class woman in Bayswater. Although that might have simply been a Bayswater way of looking at it, and Milly was currently quite interested in Bayswater ways, this assessment was so convincing that, like Mrs. Stringham herself, Milly actually got Kate to accept that she was the closest thing to a real princess that Bayswater could ever hope to have. It was a fact—established after just three days—that Milly actually began to adopt Kate’s perspective on her own situation, because Kate’s view of it was clearly so sincere. This impression was a tribute, a tribute to power, and Kate made no secret of where she believed that power came from. There were moments, in all the brightly lit shopping areas, given the size of the shops, when Kate’s easygoing, slightly detached manner was enough to suggest that if she had access to such deep pockets…!</i></p></div>

It was not moreover by any means with not having
the imagination of expenditure that she appeared
to charge her friend, but with not having the imagination
of terror, of thrift, the imagination or in any
degree the habit of a conscious dependence on others.
Such moments, when all Wigmore Street, for instance,
seemed to rustle about and the pale girl herself
to be facing the different rustlers, usually so
undiscriminated, as individual Britons too, Britons
personal, parties to a relation and perhaps even intrinsically
remarkable—such moments in especial determined
in Kate a perception of the high happiness
of her companion's liberty. Milly's range was thus
immense; she had to ask nobody for anything, to
refer nothing to any one; her freedom, her fortune
and her fancy were her law; an obsequious world
surrounded her, she could sniff up at every step its
fumes. And Kate, in these days, was altogether in
the phase of forgiving her so much bliss; in the
phase moreover of believing that, should they continue
to go on together, she would abide in that generosity.
She had, at such a point as this, no suspicion
of a rift within the lute—by which we mean not
only none of anything's coming between them, but
none of any definite flaw in so much clearness of
quality. Yet, all the same, if Milly, at Mrs. Lowder's
banquet, had described herself to Lord Mark
as kindly used by the young woman on the other side
because of some faintly-felt special propriety in it,
so there really did match with this, privately, on the
young woman's part, a feeling not analysed but
divided, a latent impression that Mildred Theale was
not, after all, a person to change places, to change
even chances with. Kate, verily, would perhaps not
quite have known what she meant by this reservation,
and she came near naming it only when she said
to herself that, rich as Milly was, one probably
wouldn't—which was singular—ever hate her for it.
The handsome girl had, with herself, these felicities
and crudities: it wasn't obscure to her that, without
some very particular reason to help, it might have
proved a test of one's philosophy not to be irritated
by a mistress of millions, or whatever they were,
who, as a girl, so easily might have been, like herself,
only vague and fatally female. She was by no
means sure of liking Aunt Maud as much as she deserved,
and Aunt Maud's command of funds was
obviously inferior to Milly's. There was thus
clearly, as pleading for the latter, some influence that
would later on become distinct; and meanwhile, decidedly,
it was enough that she was as charming as
she was queer and as queer as she was charming—all
of which was a rare amusement; as well, for that
matter, as further sufficient that there were objects
of value she had already pressed on Kate's acceptance.
A week of her society in these conditions—conditions
that Milly chose to sum up as ministering
immensely, for a blind, vague pilgrim, to aid and
comfort—announced itself from an early hour as
likely to become a week of presents, acknowledgments,
mementos, pledges of gratitude and admiration
that were all on one side. Kate as promptly
embraced the propriety of making it clear that she
must forswear shops till she should receive some
guarantee that the contents of each one she entered
as a humble companion should not be placed at her
feet; yet that was in truth not before she had found
herself in possession, under whatever protests, of
several precious ornaments and other minor conveniences.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It wasn't that she accused her friend of being extravagant, but rather of lacking the imagination to be afraid, or economical, or the imagination—or even the habit—of relying on others. In those moments, when all of Wigmore Street, for example, seemed to buzz around them, and the pale girl herself was facing the various people—usually indistinguishable, but also individual, unique people—involved in their relationship and perhaps even intrinsically interesting, those moments especially made Kate recognize how happy her friend was to be so free. Milly’s possibilities were vast; she didn’t have to ask anyone for anything, or defer to anyone; her freedom, her wealth, and her whims were her only rules. An attentive world surrounded her, and she could inhale its offerings at every turn. And in those days, Kate was completely in the process of forgiving Milly for having so much joy, and she also believed that if they stayed together, she would continue to be that generous. She had no suspicion at this point of any trouble, meaning not only that nothing would come between them, but also that there was no noticeable flaw in their apparently perfect relationship. However, even so, if Milly, at Mrs. Lowder’s party, had described herself to Lord Mark as being treated kindly by the young woman on the other side of her because she felt a certain subtle sense of appropriateness in it, then in truth there was something similar happening privately on the young woman's part, a feeling that wasn't fully understood but was divided, a hidden impression that Mildred Theale was not, after all, someone Kate would want to trade places or chances with. Kate wouldn't quite have known what she meant by this reservation, and she almost clarified it when she told herself that, rich as Milly was, one probably wouldn't—and this was strange—ever hate her for it. The beautiful girl had these good and bad qualities: it wasn't a secret that, without some very specific reason to help, it might have been a test of one's philosophy not to be annoyed by a woman who had millions, or whatever, who, as a girl, could so easily have been just as vague and inevitably female as she was. She definitely wasn't sure she liked Aunt Maud as much as she deserved, and Aunt Maud's wealth was obviously less than Milly's. Therefore, there was a clear advantage to Milly's position that would become more distinct later on; and for the time being, it was enough that she was as delightful as she was strange, and as strange as she was delightful—which was all very entertaining. Additionally, it was also sufficient that there were valuable gifts she had already given to Kate. A week of her company in these circumstances—circumstances that Milly chose to describe as tremendously helping and comforting a blind, vague pilgrim—was turning out to be a week of presents, acknowledgments, souvenirs, pledges of gratitude and admiration all coming from one side. Kate quickly agreed that she must stop shopping until she could be sure that the items in any store she entered as a humble companion wouldn't be offered to her; yet that was really only after she had found herself in possession, despite her protests, of several precious ornaments and other small conveniences.</i></p></div>

Great was the absurdity, too, that there should
have come a day, by the end of the week, when it
appeared that all Milly would have asked in definite
"return," as might be said, was to be told a little
about Lord Mark and to be promised the privilege
of a visit to Mrs. Condrip. Far other amusements
had been offered her, but her eagerness was shamelessly
human, and she seemed really to count more
on the revelation of the anxious lady of Chelsea than
on the best nights of the opera. Kate admired, and
showed it, such an absence of fear: to the fear of
being bored, in such a connection, she would have
been so obviously entitled. Milly's answer to this
was the plea of her curiosities—which left her
friend wondering as to their odd direction. Some
among them, no doubt, were rather more intelligible,
and Kate had heard without wonder that she was
blank about Lord Mark. This young lady's account
of him, at the same time, professed itself as frankly
imperfect; for what they best knew him by at Lancaster
Gate was a thing difficult to explain. One
knew people in general by something they had to
show, something that, either for them or against,
could be touched or named or proved; and she could
think of no other case of a value taken as so great
and yet flourishing untested. His value was his
future, which had somehow got itself as accepted
by Aunt Maud as if it had been his good cook or his
steam-launch. She, Kate, didn't mean she thought
him a humbug; he might do great things—but they
were all, as yet, so to speak, he had done. On the
other hand it was of course something of an achievement,
and not open to every one, to have got one's self
taken so seriously by Aunt Maud. The best
thing about him, doubtless, on the whole, was that
Aunt Maud believed in him. She was often fantastic,
but she knew a humbug, and—no, Lord Mark
wasn't that. He had been a short time in the House,
on the Tory side, but had lost his seat on the first
opportunity, and this was all he had to point to.
However, he pointed to nothing; which was very
possibly just a sign of his real cleverness, one of
those that the really clever had in common with the
really void. Even Aunt Maud frequently admitted
that there was a good deal, for her view of him, to
come up in the rear. And he wasn't meanwhile
himself indifferent—indifferent to himself—for
he was working Lancaster Gate for all it was
worth: just as it was, no doubt, working <i>him,</i>
and just as the working and the worked were in
London, as one might explain, the parties to every
relation.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was also pretty absurd that, by the end of the week, it seemed all Milly wanted in exchange for everything was to hear a bit about Lord Mark and be promised a visit to Mrs. Condrip. She'd been offered other things, but her enthusiasm was completely normal, and she seemed more excited about getting information from the worried lady in Chelsea than attending the best opera performances. Kate admired this lack of fear, and made it clear; Milly, in her position, would have been completely justified in being afraid of being bored. Milly's explanation was her curiosity, which made her friend wonder why she was interested in those particular things. Some of her curiosities were easier to understand, and Kate wasn’t surprised to hear that Milly knew very little about Lord Mark. Kate’s own description of him was also honestly incomplete because it was hard to describe him based on what they knew at Lancaster Gate. One usually knew people by what they had to show, something that could be seen, named, or proven. But she couldn't think of another instance where someone's worth was so high and yet unproven. His worth was based on his future, which Aunt Maud had somehow accepted as fact, just as if he had a good cook or a steam-powered boat. Kate wasn’t suggesting he was a fraud; he might do great things—but as of now, he hadn’t done anything. On the other hand, getting Aunt Maud to take you so seriously was certainly an accomplishment that not everyone could achieve. The best thing about him, no doubt, was that Aunt Maud believed in him. She was often eccentric, but she could spot a fake, and, no, Lord Mark wasn't that. He’d briefly been a member of Parliament, a Conservative, but had lost his seat right away, and that was all he could point to. However, he didn't point to anything, which might be a sign of his intelligence, one of those traits that the truly clever people shared with those who were empty-headed. Even Aunt Maud often admitted that there was a lot about him that remained to be seen. And in the meantime, he wasn’t indifferent—indifferent to himself—as he was actively trying to exploit Lancaster Gate: just as, no doubt, it was exploiting him, and just as the one who does the exploiting and the one who is exploited are, in London, the two sides of every relationship.</i></p></div>

Kate did explain, for her listening friend: every
one who had anything to give—it was true they were
the fewest—made the sharpest possible bargain for
it, got at least its value in return. The strangest
thing, furthermore, was that this might be, in cases,
a happy understanding. The worker in one connection
was the worked in another; it was as broad as
it was long—with the wheels of the system, as might
be seen, wonderfully oiled. People could quite like
each other in the midst of it, as Aunt Maud, by every
appearance, quite liked Lord Mark, and as Lord
Mark, it was to be hoped, liked Mrs. Lowder, since
if he didn't he was a greater brute than one could believe.
She, Kate, had not yet, it was true, made out
what he was doing for her—besides which the dear
woman needed him, even at the most he could do,
much less than she imagined; so far as all of which
went, moreover, there were plenty of things on every
side she had not yet made out. She believed, on the
whole, in any one Aunt Maud took up; and she gave
it to Milly as worth thinking of that, whatever wonderful
people this young lady might meet in the land,
she would meet no more extraordinary woman.
There were greater celebrities by the million, and of
course greater swells, but a bigger <i>person,</i> by Kate's
view, and a larger natural handful every way, would
really be far to seek. When Milly inquired with interest
if Kate's belief in <i>her</i> was primarily on the
lines of what Mrs. Lowder "took up," her interlocutress
could handsomely say yes, since by the same
principle she believed in herself. Whom but Aunt
Maud's niece, pre-eminently, had Aunt Maud taken
up, and who was thus more in the current, with her,
of working and of being worked? "You may ask,"
Kate said, "what in the world I have to give; and
that indeed is just what I'm trying to learn. There
must be something, for her to think she can get it
out of me. She <i>will</i> get it—trust her; and then I
shall see what it is; which I beg you to believe I
should never have found out for myself." She declined
to treat any question of Milly's own "paying"
power as discussable; that Milly would pay a
hundred per cent.—and even to the end, doubtless,
through the nose—was just the beautiful basis on
which they found themselves.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate explained to her friend Milly: everyone who had something to offer – and those people were the fewest – drove the hardest possible bargain, getting at least its value in return. The strangest thing was that this could, in some cases, be a mutually beneficial arrangement. The person using someone else was also being used by someone else; it was a fair exchange – with the gears of the system, as you could see, running smoothly. People could genuinely like each other within it, just as Aunt Maud, seemingly, liked Lord Mark, and hopefully, Lord Mark liked Mrs. Lowder. Otherwise, he was a bigger jerk than one would imagine.</i></p><p><i>Kate hadn't yet figured out what Lord Mark was doing for her – and the dear woman needed him, even with what he was doing, which was less than she realized. Besides that, there were plenty of things she hadn't figured out on all sides. She generally trusted anyone Aunt Maud approved of. And she told Milly that it was worth considering that, no matter how many impressive people Milly might meet, she wouldn't meet a more extraordinary woman than Aunt Maud. There were millions of more famous people, and of course, more wealthy people, but Kate thought it would be difficult to find anyone more impressive, or with more natural strength.</i></p><p><i>When Milly asked if Kate's belief in her was based primarily on Aunt Maud's approval, Kate could honestly say yes, because she believed in herself based on the same principle. Who else had Aunt Maud taken under her wing, more than her own niece? Who was more involved in this system of using and being used, alongside her? "You might ask," Kate said, "what I have to offer. That’s exactly what I’m trying to figure out. There must be something, for her to think she can get something from me. She will get it – trust her. And then I’ll see what it is, which I swear I would never have figured out on my own." She refused to discuss the idea of Milly "paying" for anything; that Milly would pay generously – and likely be taken advantage of in the end – was the very foundation of their relationship.</i></p></div>

<p>
These were fine facilities, pleasantries, ironies, all
these luxuries of gossip and philosophies of London
and of life, and they became quickly, between the
pair, the common form of talk, Milly professing herself
delighted to know that something was to be done
with her. If the most remarkable woman in England
was to do it, so much the better, and if the most
remarkable woman in England had them both in
hand together, why, what could be jollier for each?
When she reflected indeed a little on the oddity of
her wanting two at once, Kate had the natural reply
that it was exactly what showed her sincerity. She
invariably gave way to feeling, and feeling had distinctly
popped up in her on the advent of her girlhood's
friend. The way the cat would jump was
always, in presence of anything that moved her, interesting
to see; visibly enough, moreover, for a
long time, it hadn't jumped anything like so far.
This, in fact, as we already know, remained the marvel
for Milly Theale, who, on sight of Mrs. Lowder,
found fifty links in respect to Susie absent from the
chain of association. She knew so herself what she
thought of Susie that she would have expected the
lady of Lancaster Gate to think something quite different;
the failure of which endlessly mystified her.
But her mystification was the cause for her of another
fine impression, inasmuch as when she went
so far as to observe to Kate that Susan Shepherd—and
especially Susan Shepherd emerging so uninvited
from an irrelevant past—ought, by all the proprieties,
simply to have bored Aunt Maud, her confidant
agreed with her without a protest and abounded
in the sense of her wonder. Susan Shepherd at
least bored the niece—that was plain; this young
woman saw nothing in her—nothing to account for
anything, not even for Milly's own indulgence:
which little fact became in turn to the latter's mind
a fact of significance. It was a light on the handsome
girl—representing more than merely showed—that
poor Susie was simply as nought to her. This
was, in a manner too, a general admonition to poor
Susie's companion, who seemed to see marked by it
the direction in which she had best most look out.

It just faintly rankled in her that a person who was
good enough and to spare for Milly Theale shouldn't
be good enough for another girl; though, oddly
enough, she could easily have forgiven Mrs. Lowder
herself the impatience. Mrs. Lowder didn't feel it,
and Kate Croy felt it with ease; yet in the end, be
it added, she grasped the reason, and the reason enriched
her mind. Wasn't it sufficiently the reason
that the handsome girl was, with twenty other splendid
qualities, the least bit brutal too, and didn't she
suggest, as no one yet had ever done for her new
friend, that there might be a wild beauty in that, and
even a strange grace? Kate wasn't brutally brutal—which
Milly had hitherto benightedly supposed
the only way; she wasn't even aggressively so, but
rather indifferently, defensively and, as might be
said, by the habit of anticipation. She simplified in
advance, was beforehand with her doubts, and knew
with singular quickness what she wasn't, as they
said in New York, going to like. In that way at
least people were clearly quicker in England than at
home; and Milly could quite see, after a little, how
such instincts might become usual in a world in
which dangers abounded. There were more dangers,
clearly, round about Lancaster Gate than one
suspected in New York or could dream of in Boston.
At all events, with more sense of them, there were
more precautions, and it was a remarkable world
altogether in which there could be precautions, on
whatever ground, against Susie.

Kate Croy easily felt the impatience, but ultimately she understood the reason, and that understanding made her smarter. Wasn't the reason obvious? The beautiful girl, along with many other amazing qualities, was also a little insensitive. Didn't this girl, for the first time, hint to Kate's new friend that there might be something wild and beautiful, even graceful, in that insensitivity? Kate wasn't overtly cruel, which Milly had mistakenly thought was the only kind of cruelty. She wasn't even aggressively cruel, but rather indifferent, defensive, and as though she'd developed the habit of anticipating negativity. She made assumptions in advance, preempted her own doubts, and knew almost immediately what she wouldn't like. In that way, at least, people in England seemed faster to judge than people back home. Milly could quickly see how such instincts might be common in a world full of threats. There were clearly more dangers around Lancaster Gate than anyone in New York even suspected or in Boston could imagine.

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>During a drive in Battersea Park, Susan (Susie) Shepherd learns from Mrs. Lowder that Mrs. Lowder and her niece, Kate Croy, are acquainted with Milly's friend, Mr. Merton Densher. Later, Susie tells Milly this news. Milly acts surprised. Susie explains that Mrs. Lowder mentioned a young journalist who had gone to America, and Susie confirmed it was Mr. Densher, an acquaintance of Milly's.</p><p>Milly tells Susie that she did the right thing in revealing the connection. Susie then relays a message from Mrs. Lowder: Milly should not mention Mr. Densher to Kate unless Kate brings him up first. Milly asks if there is something between Kate and Mr. Densher. Susie says she thinks not, but Mrs. Lowder is being cautious. Susie adds that Mrs. Lowder wants her niece to marry Lord Mark.</p><p>For the next few days, Milly observes Kate, knowing that Kate also knows Mr. Densher, but says nothing to her about it.</p><p>Milly and Kate visit Kate’s sister, Mrs. Condrip. Later that evening, Milly tells Susie what happened during the visit. While Kate was out of the room, Mrs. Condrip told Milly that Mr. Densher is in love with Kate, which she considers a dreadful situation because of his poverty. Mrs. Condrip asked Milly to help do something about it and also asked Milly not to tell Kate about their conversation. Milly did not tell Mrs. Condrip that she herself knew Mr. Densher.</p><p>Milly tells Susie that according to Mrs. Condrip, Mrs. Lowder disapproves of Mr. Densher. Susie corrects this, saying Mrs. Lowder actually likes him and thinks he is very able. Milly and Susie discuss the situation. Milly believes that if Mrs. Condrip knew that Milly also knew Densher, she would tell Kate in order to make Kate jealous and turn her against him. Milly concludes the conversation by clarifying that Mrs. Condrip only said that Densher was in love with Kate, not that Kate was in love with him. She says that if Kate were in love, Mrs. Condrip would have said so.</p>

<div class="analysis-box">
<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Milly is presented as a character with a stark public/private divide. In public, she can be "detached as the occasion required," but in private, she is deeply intimate and open with her confidante, Susan Shepherd. She is wealthy, observant, and possesses a "strange gaiety" coupled with a fascination for social complexity, stating, "I want abysses." She also displays a morbid, fatalistic humor regarding a fragile health condition.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically with the news that her new friend, Kate Croy, and her circle already know her recent acquaintance, Merton Densher. This revelation "altered all proportions" for her, turning an amusing coincidence into a "new sort of fun" containing "a small element of anxiety." She immediately becomes a participant in a social intrigue, agreeing to keep her knowledge of Densher a secret from Kate.</li>
<li>*Susan Shepherd (Susie/Mrs. Stringham)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is Milly's loyal, devoted, and sometimes "venerably simple" companion. She serves as Milly's primary confidante and feels a protective, almost maternal duty towards her ("I'd die for you"). She is presented as a somewhat flustered navigator of the complex English social world she has been "rapt" into.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts from passive companion to active agent in the plot. By relaying the news about Densher from Mrs. Lowder, and later receiving an unsolicited confession from Mrs. Condrip, she becomes the keeper of multiple secrets and a key conduit of information between the other characters.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Kate is presented almost entirely through Milly's changing perception. Initially, she is a "handsome" new friend with whom Milly shares a "deep" and "sudden" intimacy. She is also positioned as being under the social control of her aunt, "involved in her aunt's designs."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** With the revelation of her connection to Densher, she is immediately recast in Milly's mind as a person with a hidden, "not wholly calculable" side. Her silence on the subject of Densher transforms her from a transparent friend into an enigma, surrounded by a "great darkness."</li>
<li>*Merton Densher**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** He is an off-stage character whose identity is built through the conflicting reports of others. He is a "young journalist" who is described by Mrs. Condrip as poor and lacking prospects, but by Mrs. Lowder as "exceptionally able."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** He is abruptly transformed from a minor New York acquaintance of Milly's into the central figure of a complex social secret linking all the main characters. His prior silence about his English friends is suddenly rendered significant.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is a formidable and manipulative social strategist. She is wealthy, powerful, and intent on controlling her niece's future, specifically by arranging a marriage to Lord Mark. She is presented as shrewdly precautionary, immediately moving to control the flow of information about Densher.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** The unexpected appearance of Milly, who also knows Densher, introduces an unknown variable into her carefully managed plans for Kate, prompting her immediate directive for silence.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Condrip (Marian)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Kate's sister, she lives in a lower social sphere ("in quite another geography"). She is portrayed as worried, perhaps meddlesome, and unimpressed by her sister's world.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** She acts as an unplanned catalyst. By impulsively revealing to Milly that Densher is in love with Kate and that she considers the match "dreadful," she confirms the romantic nature of the secret and escalates the intrigue.</li></ul>

She certainly made up with Susie directly, however,
for any allowance she might have had privately to
extend to tepid appreciation; since the late and long
talks of these two embraced not only everything
offered and suggested by the hours they spent apart,
but a good deal more besides. She might be as detached
as the occasion required at four o'clock in the
afternoon, but she used no such freedom to any one
about anything as she habitually used about everything
to Susan Shepherd at midnight. All the same,
it should with much less delay than this have been
mentioned, she had not yet—had not, that is, at the
end of six days—produced any news for her comrade
to compare with an announcement made her by the
latter as a result of a drive with Mrs. Lowder, for a
change, in the remarkable Battersea Park. The
elder friends had sociably revolved there while the
younger ones followed bolder fancies in the admirable
equipage appointed to Milly at the hotel—a
heavier, more emblazoned, more amusing chariot
than she had ever, with "stables" notoriously mismanaged,
known at home; whereby, in the course
of the circuit, more than once repeated, it had "come
out," as Mrs. Stringham said, that the couple at Lancaster
Gate were, of all people, acquainted with Mildred's
other English friend—the gentleman, the one
connected with the English newspaper (Susie hung
fire a little over his name) who had been with her
in New York so shortly previous to present adventures.
He had been named of course in Battersea
Park—else he couldn't have been identified; and
Susie had naturally, before she could produce her
own share in the matter as a kind of confession, to
make it plain that her allusion was to Mr. Merton
Densher. This was because Milly had at first a little
air of not knowing whom she meant; and the girl
really kept, as well, a certain control of herself while
she remarked that the case was surprising, the chance
one in a thousand. They knew him, both Maud
and Miss Croy knew him, she gathered too, rather
well, though indeed it was not on any show of intimacy
that he had happened to be mentioned. It had
not been—Susie made the point—she herself who
brought him in: he had in fact not been brought in
at all, but only referred to as a young journalist
known to Mrs. Lowder and who had lately gone to
their wonderful country—Mrs. Lowder always said
"your wonderful country"—on behalf of his journal.
But Mrs. Stringham had taken it up—with the tips
of her fingers indeed; and that was the confession:
she had, without meaning any harm, recognised Mr.
Densher as an acquaintance of Milly's, though she
had also pulled herself up before getting in too far.
Mrs. Lowder had been struck, clearly—it wasn't too
much to say; then she also, it had rather seemed, had
pulled herself up; and there had been a little moment
during which each might have been keeping something
from the other. "Only," said Milly's mate,
"I luckily remembered in time that I had nothing
whatever to keep—which was much simpler and
nicer. I don't know what Maud has, but there it
is. She was interested, distinctly, in your knowing
him—in his having met you over there with so little
loss of time. But I ventured to tell her it hadn't
been so long as to make you as yet great friends.
I don't know if I was right."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She immediately made up with Susie, though, for any slight reservations she might have had. Their late-night conversations covered everything that had happened and been discussed while they were apart, and even more. She could be as reserved as the situation required in the afternoon, but she was never so guarded with anyone as she was with Susie at midnight. However, she should have mentioned this sooner. She hadn't yet, after six days, given Susie any news to match Susie’s, which she’d gotten after a drive with Mrs. Lowder, a change of pace, in Battersea Park. The older women had socialized there while the younger women indulged bolder fantasies in Milly’s wonderful carriage from the hotel—a more elaborate and impressive one than she’d ever had at home, where things were in disarray. During their drive around the park, it had come out, as Mrs. Stringham said, that the people at Lancaster Gate knew, of all people, Mildred’s other English friend—the man who worked for the English newspaper (Susie paused for his name) and had been with her in New York recently. He’d been mentioned in Battersea Park, of course, or they wouldn’t have realized who they were talking about. Susie, before sharing her own news as a confession, had to clarify that she was talking about Mr. Merton Densher. Milly had seemed at first not to know who she meant, and she kept herself under control while saying the situation was surprising, a one-in-a-thousand chance. Maud and Miss Croy knew him too, Susie understood, rather well, although their acquaintance hadn't been mentioned in a very intimate way. Susie pointed out that she hadn't brought him up; he hadn't actually been brought up, but only referred to as a young journalist known to Mrs. Lowder, who had recently gone to "your wonderful country" (as Mrs. Lowder always said) for his newspaper. Mrs. Stringham had taken it up with barely a touch, and that was the confession: she’d, without meaning any harm, recognized Mr. Densher as an acquaintance of Milly's, although she’d also stopped herself before going too far. Mrs. Lowder was clearly impressed, it was no exaggeration to say; then, she too had seemed to stop herself. There was a moment when each of them might have been hiding something. "But," said Milly's friend, "I was lucky enough to remember in time that I had nothing to hide, which was much simpler and nicer. I don't know what Maud has, but there it is. She was definitely interested that you knew him—that he'd met you so quickly over there. But I told her it hadn’t been long enough for you to be great friends yet. I don't know if I was right."</i></p></div>

Whatever time this explanation might have taken,
there had been moments enough in the matter now—before
the elder woman's conscience had done itself
justice—to enable Milly to reply that although the
fact in question doubtless had its importance she
imagined they wouldn't find the importance overwhelming.
It <i>was</i> odd that their one Englishman
should so instantly fit; it wasn't, however, miraculous—they
surely all had often seen that, as every
one said, the world was extraordinarily "small."
Undoubtedly, too, Susie had done just the plain
thing in not letting his name pass. Why in the
world should there be a mystery?—and what an immense
one they would appear to have made if he
should come back and find they had concealed their
knowledge of him! "I don't know, Susie dear,"
the girl observed, "what you think I have to conceal."

Milly had, under her comrade's eyes, a minute of
mute detachment. She had lived with Kate Croy
for several days in a state of intimacy as deep as it
had been sudden, and they had clearly, in talk, in
many directions, proceeded to various extremities.
Yet it now came over her as in a clear cold way that
there was a possible account of their relations in
which the quantity her new friend had told her might
have figured as small, as smallest, beside the quantity
she hadn't. She couldn't say, at any rate, whether
or no she had made the point that her aunt designed
her for Lord Mark: it had only sufficiently come
out—which had been, moreover, eminently guessable—that
she was involved in her aunt's designs.
Somehow, for Milly, brush it over nervously as she
might and with whatever simplifying hand, this
abrupt extrusion of Mr. Densher altered all proportions,
had an effect on all values. It was fantastic
of her to let it make a difference that she couldn't
in the least have defined—and she was at least, even
during these instants, rather proud of being able to
hide, on the spot, the difference it did make. Yet,
all the same, the effect for her was, almost violently,
of Mr. Densher's having been there—having been
where she had stood till now in her simplicity—before
her. It would have taken but another free moment
to make her see abysses—since abysses were
what she wanted—in the mere circumstance of his
own silence, in New York, about his English friends.
There had really been in New York little time for
anything; but, had she liked, Milly could have made
it out for herself that he had avoided the subject of
Miss Croy, and that Miss Croy was yet a subject it
could never be natural to avoid. It was to be added
at the same time that even if his silence had been
labyrinthe—which was absurd in view of all the
other things too he couldn't possibly have spoken of—this
was exactly what must suit her, since it fell
under the head of the plea she had just uttered to
Susie. These things, however, came and went, and
it set itself up between the companions, for the occasion,
in the oddest way, both that their happening all
to know Mr. Densher—except indeed that Susie
didn't, but probably would,—was a fact belonging,
in a world of rushing about, to one of the common
orders of chance; and yet further that it was amusing—oh,
awfully amusing!—to be able fondly to
hope that there was "something in" its having been
left to crop up with such suddenness. There seemed
somehow a possibility that the ground or, as it were,
the air might, in a manner, have undergone some
pleasing preparation; though the question of this
possibility would probably, after all, have taken some
threshing out. The truth, moreover—and there
they were, already, our pair, talking about it, the
"truth!"—had not in fact quite cropped out. This,
obviously, in view of Mrs. Lowder's request to her
old friend.

<p>
It was accordingly on Mrs. Lowder's recommendation
that nothing should be said to Kate—it was
on this rich attitude of Aunt Maud's that the idea
of an interesting complication might best hope to
perch; and when, in fact, after the colloquy we have
reported Milly saw Kate again without mentioning
any name, her silence succeeded in passing muster
with her as the beginning of a new sort of fun. The
sort was all the newer by reason of its containing a
small element of anxiety: when she had gone in for
fun before it had been with her hands a little more
free. Yet it <i>was,</i> none the less, rather exciting to
be conscious of a still sharper reason for interest in
the handsome girl, as Kate continued, even now, pre-eminently
to remain for her; and a reason—this was
the great point—of which the young woman herself
could have no suspicion. Twice over, thus, for two
or three hours together, Milly found herself seeing
Kate, quite fixing her in the light of the knowledge
that it was a face on which Mr. Densher's eyes had
more or less familiarly rested and which, by the same
token, had looked, rather <i>more</i> beautifully than less,
into his own. She pulled herself up indeed with the
thought that it had inevitably looked, as beautifully
as one would, into thousands of faces in which one
might one's self never trace it; but just the odd result
of the thought was to intensify for the girl that
side of her friend which she had doubtless already
been more prepared than she quite knew to think of
as the "other," the not wholly calculable. It was
fantastic, and Milly was aware of this; but the
other side was what had, of a sudden, been turned
straight towards her by the show of Mr. Densher's
propinquity. She hadn't the excuse of knowing it
for Kate's own, since nothing whatever as yet proved
it particularly to be such. Never mind; it was with
this other side now fully presented that Kate came
and went, kissed her for greeting and for parting,
talked, as usual, of everything but—as it had so
abruptly become for Milly—<i>the</i> thing. Our young
woman, it is true, would doubtless not have tasted
so sharply a difference in this pair of occasions had
she not been tasting so peculiarly her own possible
betrayals. What happened was that afterwards, on
separation, she wondered if the matter had not mainly
been that she herself was so "other," so taken up
with the unspoken; the strangest thing of all being,
still subsequently, that when she asked herself how
Kate could have failed to feel it she became conscious
of being here on the edge of a great darkness. She
should never know how Kate truly felt about anything
such a one as Milly Theale should give her to
feel. Kate would never—and not from ill-will, nor
from duplicity, but from a sort of failure of common
terms—reduce it to such a one's comprehension or
put it within her convenience.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Following Mrs. Lowder's advice, nothing was to be said to Kate. This rich, confident attitude of Aunt Maud's was the best foundation for an intriguing situation to develop. And indeed, after the conversation we described, when Milly saw Kate again without mentioning anyone's name, her silence seemed to Kate like the start of a new, enjoyable game. It was a new kind of game because it had a small element of worry: when she'd had fun before, she'd been more carefree. Still, it was exciting to have a sharper reason for interest in the beautiful girl, as Kate remained for her, and a reason—this was the crucial point—that the young woman herself knew nothing about. Twice, for a few hours each time, Milly found herself observing Kate, seeing her with the clear knowledge that this was a face that Mr. Densher had looked at more or less intimately and that, by the same token, had looked, quite beautifully, into his. She stopped herself with the thought that Kate's face had inevitably looked as beautifully as anyone would into thousands of faces where she might never see it herself. But the odd thing was that this thought intensified for Milly the part of her friend that she was already prepared to think of as the "other," the unpredictable side. It was a fantasy, and Milly knew this, but the other side had suddenly been revealed by Mr. Densher's closeness. She couldn't claim it as Kate's own, since nothing yet proved it was. Never mind; it was with this other side fully present that Kate came and went, kissed her hello and goodbye, and talked, as usual, about everything but—as it had abruptly become for Milly—the crucial issue. Of course, our young woman wouldn't have felt this difference so strongly if she hadn't been so aware of her own possible betrayal. Afterwards, she wondered if the main issue was that she herself was so "other," so preoccupied with the unspoken. The strangest thing of all was that when she asked herself how Kate could have failed to sense it, she realized she was on the edge of a great mystery. She would never know how Kate truly felt about something that a person like Milly Theale would allow her to feel. Kate would never—not out of malice or deceit, but out of a lack of shared understanding—bring it down to such a person's level of comprehension or make it convenient for her.</i></p></div>

<p>
It was as such a one, therefore, that, for three or
four days more, Milly watched Kate as just such
another; and it was presently as such a one that she
threw herself into their promised visit, at last
achieved, to Chelsea, the quarter of the famous Carlyle,
the field of exercise of his ghost, his votaries,
and the residence of "poor Marian," so often referred
to and actually a somewhat incongruous spirit
there. With our young woman's first view of poor
Marian everything gave way but the sense of how,
in England, apparently, the social situation of sisters
could be opposed, how common ground, for a place
in the world, could quite fail them: a state of things
sagely perceived to be involved in an hierarchical, an
aristocratic order. Just whereabouts in the order
Mrs. Lowder had established her niece was a question
not wholly void, as yet, no doubt, of ambiguity—though
Milly was withal sure Lord Mark could
exactly have fixed the point if he would, fixing it at
the same time for Aunt Maud herself; but it was
clear that Mrs. Condrip was, as might have been said,
in quite another geography. She would not, in
short, have been to be found on the same social map,
and it was as if her visitors had turned over page
after page together before the final relief of their
benevolent "Here!" The interval was bridged,
of course, but the bridge, verily, was needed, and the
impression left Milly to wonder whether, in the general
connection, it were of bridges or of intervals
that the spirit not locally disciplined would find itself
most conscious. It was as if at home, by contrast,
there were neither—neither the difference
itself, from position to position, nor, on either side,
and particularly on one, the awfully good manner,
the conscious sinking of a consciousness, that made
up for it. The conscious sinking, at all events, and
the awfully good manner, the difference, the bridge,
the interval, the skipped leaves of the social atlas—these,
it was to be confessed, had a little, for our
young lady, in default of stouter stuff, to work themselves
into the light literary legend—a mixed, wandering
echo of Trollope, of Thackeray, perhaps
mostly of Dickens—under favour of which her pilgrimage
had so much appealed. She could relate
to Susie later on, late the same evening, that the
legend, before she had done with it, had run clear,
that the adored author of <i>The Newcomes</i>, in fine, had
been on the whole the note: the picture lacking thus
more than she had hoped, or rather perhaps showing
less than she had feared, a certain possibility of Pickwickian
outline. She explained how she meant by
this that Mrs. Condrip had not altogether proved another
Mrs. Nickleby, nor even—for she might have
proved almost anything, from the way poor worried
Kate had spoken—a widowed and aggravated Mrs.
Micawber.

Mrs. Stringham, in the midnight conference, intimated
rather yearningly that, however the event
might have turned, the side of English life such experiences
opened to Milly were just those she herself
seemed "booked"—as they were all, roundabout
her now, always saying—to miss: she had begun to
have a little, for her fellow-observer, these moments
of fanciful reaction—reaction in which she was once
more all Susan Shepherd—against the high sphere
of colder conventions into which her overwhelming
connection with Maud Manningham had rapt her.
Milly never lost sight, for long, of the Susan Shepherd
side of her, and was always there to meet it
when it came up and vaguely, tenderly, impatiently
to pat it, abounding in the assurance that they would
still provide for it. They had, however, to-night,
another matter in hand; which proved to be presently,
on the girl's part, in respect to her hour of
Chelsea, the revelation that Mrs. Condrip, taking a
few minutes when Kate was away with one of the
children, in bed upstairs for some small complaint,
had suddenly, without its being in the least "led up
to," broken ground on the subject of Mr. Densher,
mentioned him with impatience as a person in love

The girl had by this time clearly made it out.
"Nothing but to admire and make much of her sister—whom
she doesn't, however, herself in the least
understand—and give up one's time, and everything
else, to it." It struck the elder friend that she spoke
with an almost unprecedented approach to sharpness;
as if Mrs. Condrip had been rather specially
disconcerting. Never yet so much as just of late
had Mrs. Stringham seen her companion as exalted,
and by the very play of something within, into a
vague golden air that left irritation below. That
was the great thing with Milly—it was her characteristic
poetry; or at least it was Susan Shepherd's.
"But she made a point," the former continued, "of
my keeping what she says from Kate. I'm not to
mention that she has spoken."

Milly had, she thought, an hesitation—something

"Then there it is!" On which, with a drop and
one of those sudden, slightly sighing surrenders to
a vague reflux and a general fatigue that had recently
more than once marked themselves for her companion,
Milly turned away. Yet the matter was not
left so, that night, between them, albeit neither perhaps
could afterwards have said which had first
come back to it. Milly's own nearest approach, at
least, for a little, to doing so, was to remark that they
appeared all—every one they saw—to think tremendously
of money. This prompted in Susie a laugh,
not untender, the innocent meaning of which was
that it came, as a subject for indifference, money
did, easier to some people than to others: she made
the point in fairness, however, that you couldn't have
told, by any too crude transparency of air, what
place it held for Maud Manningham. She did
her worldliness with grand proper silences—if it
mightn't better be put perhaps that she did her detachment
with grand occasional pushes. However
Susie put it, in truth, she was really, in justice to herself,
thinking of the difference, as favourites of fortune,
between her old friend and her new. Aunt
Maud sat somehow in the midst of her money,
founded on it and surrounded by it, even if with a
clever high manner about it, her manner of looking,
hard and bright, as if it weren't there. Milly, about
hers, had no manner at all—which was possibly,
from a point of view, a fault: she was at any rate
far away on the edge of it, and you hadn't, as might
be said, in order to get at her nature, to traverse, by
whatever avenue, any piece of her property. It was
clear, on the other hand, that Mrs. Lowder was keeping
her wealth as for purposes, imaginations, ambitions,
that would figure as large, as honourably unselfish,
on the day they should take effect. She
would impose her will, but her will would be only
that a person or two shouldn't lose a benefit by not
submitting if they could be made to submit. To
Milly, as so much younger, such far views couldn't
be imputed: there was nobody she was supposable
as interested for. It was too soon, since she wasn't
interested for herself. Even the richest woman, at
her age, lacked motive, and Milly's motive doubtless
had plenty of time to arrive. She was meanwhile
beautiful, simple, sublime without it—whether missing
it and vaguely reaching out for it or not; and
with it, for that matter, in the event, would really be
these things just as much. Only then she might
very well have, like Aunt Maud, a manner. Such
were the connections, at all events, in which the colloquy
of our two ladies freshly flickered up—in which
it came round that the elder asked the younger if she
had herself, in the afternoon, named Mr. Densher
as an acquaintance.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"Well, that's that," Milly said with a sigh, her body relaxing into a weary surrender, something her companion had noticed more and more lately. Then she turned away. But that night, the subject came up again between them, though neither could later recall who brought it up first. Milly's initial observation was that everyone they knew seemed obsessed with money. Susie laughed gently, suggesting some people find money easier to ignore than others. She pointed out that it was impossible to tell what money meant to Maud Manningham. Maud carried herself with a sophisticated, distant air, though perhaps it was more accurate to say she acted detached with occasional displays of force. Regardless of how Susie phrased it, she was really thinking about the contrast between her old friend and her new one, both beneficiaries of good fortune. Aunt Maud seemed to sit at the center of her wealth, built upon it and surrounded by it, even if she adopted a clever, aloof demeanor, as if the money wasn't even there. Milly, on the other hand, had no such facade, which might be a flaw. She was far removed from her wealth, and you didn't have to navigate any of her possessions to understand her character. Mrs. Lowder, however, clearly intended to use her wealth to pursue goals, ambitions, and plans that would seem grand and selfless when they came to fruition. She would impose her will, but only to ensure that someone wouldn't miss an opportunity if they could be persuaded to cooperate. Milly, being much younger, couldn't be accused of such long-term planning, as she had no one to look out for. She wasn't even looking out for herself yet. Even the wealthiest woman at her age lacked that drive, and Milly certainly had time to develop it. For now, she was beautiful, simple, and naturally admirable, regardless of whether she desired money or not; in the end, it wouldn't change any of those things. Only then, she might develop a manner like Aunt Maud. That's how the conversation between the two women rekindled, leading the older woman to ask the younger if she had mentioned Mr. Densher as an acquaintance that afternoon.</i></p></div>

Since I've spent all these years feeling like I'm already dead, I'll probably die looking like I'm alive—which is what you want, right? So," she concluded, "you'll never truly know where I am. Except, of course, when I'm gone; then you'll only know where I'm not."</i></p></div>

"No, abroad—to Switzerland, Italy, anywhere.
I mean by your staying here for me," Milly pursued,
"your staying with me wherever I may be,
even though we may neither of us know at the time
where it is. No," she insisted, "I <i>don't</i> know where
I am, and you never will, and it doesn't matter—and
I dare say it's quite true," she broke off, "that everything
will have to come out." Her friend would
have felt of her that she joked about it now, had not
her scale from grave to gay been a thing of such
unnamable shades that her contrasts were never
sharp. She made up for failures of gravity by failures
of mirth; if she hadn't, that is, been at times
as earnest as might have been liked, so she was certain
not to be at other times as easy as she would like
herself. "I must face the music. It isn't, at any
rate, its 'coming out,'" she added; "it's that Mrs.
Condrip would put the fact before her to his injury."

Milly neither accepted nor qualified this; she only
said, after a moment, as with a conscious excess of
the pensive: "No, I don't think she'd quite wish to
suggest that I made up to <i>him;</i> for that I should have
had to do so would only bring out his constancy. All
I mean is," she added—and now at last, as with a
supreme impatience "that her being able to make
him out a little a person who could give cause for
jealousy would evidently help her, since she's afraid

Susan Shepherd perceived in this explanation such
signs of an appetite for motive as would have sat
gracefully even on one of her own New England
heroines. It was seeing round several corners; but
that was what New England heroines did, and it
was moreover interesting for the moment to make
out how many really her young friend had undertaken
to see round. Finally, too, weren't they braving
the deeps? They got their amusement where
they could. "Isn't it only," she asked, "rather

<div class="summary-box">
<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Lord Mark visited Milly and Susan Shepherd at their hotel on several occasions. He then brought them to a social gathering at a large historic house.</p><p>At the gathering, Milly was introduced to new people and walked through the house's halls. She accepted and drank a cup of iced coffee. During this time, Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud) told Milly she must stay with them and could stay in any position she wished.</p><p>Milly and Mrs. Lowder observed Kate Croy. Milly told Mrs. Lowder that Kate was the handsomest person there, lovely, and always right. Mrs. Lowder agreed that Kate was a luxury to have. As they talked, Lord Mark passed and repassed before them. A servant took Milly's empty ice-plate.</p><p>Mrs. Lowder continued speaking to Milly, urging her to make her home with them, to let them take care of her, and to help with Kate. She stated that Milly and Kate must stand together because together they could do anything, and that her plans for Kate also required Milly's prosperity.</p>
</div>
<div class="analysis-box">
<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Lord Mark**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** He is presented as a persistent and subtly manipulative social operator. He seeks validation from Milly, wanting her to acknowledge his importance. He orchestrates the grand social experience for the women, acting as a "supervisory friend" while making it clear, non-verbally, that Milly is the true reason for his efforts. He is a key component in Mrs. Lowder's social maneuvering, a valuable piece she is "working in" to her design.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** His intention to impress Milly and correct her "injustice" has succeeded. He has successfully engineered a situation that has charmed her and created a "friendly understanding" between them, shifting him from a mere pursuer to an effective social power player in her eyes.</li>
<li>*Milly**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is highly observant, introspective, and impressionable, though with a sharp underlying awareness. She is physically described as a "poor shaky maiden" but possesses a rich internal life, viewing the social scene with a mix of awe and analytical curiosity. She feels overwhelmed by the grandeur but is perceptive enough to see the machinations of Lord Mark and Mrs. Lowder.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically from being a guest at a party to becoming its focal point. Mrs. Lowder explicitly tells her she "is the matter," and that she can have any position she wants. This moves her from a passive observer to the designated centerpiece of the social plan, a realization that serves as a "climax" for her.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is a powerful, effusive, and strategic woman, described as a "natural force." She is in a state of high satisfaction, seeing her plans and affections align. She uses grand, persuasive language to envelop Milly in her designs, seeing the girl's prosperity as essential to her niece Kate's. She is actively weaving the people around her into a "free and genial" but definite plan.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her plans "enlarge and uplift." Having successfully brought Milly into this grand setting, she shifts from mere hospitality to an open campaign to secure Milly's permanent place within her circle, making her happiness and future integral to the family's social success.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is presented through Milly’s admiring perspective as a beautiful, enigmatic, and socially perfect figure. She has the ability to appear as a "beautiful stranger," making her a constant subject of curiosity. Milly sees her as being "made for great social uses" and always "so right." For Mrs. Lowder, she is a prized asset, a "luxury to take about the world."</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Her situation is not shifted directly but is powerfully reinforced. The successful integration of Milly into their circle solidifies Kate’s own position, as Mrs. Lowder’s plan now requires both young women to prosper together.</li>
<li>*Susan Shepherd (Susie)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** She is a gentle, secondary figure who is valued for her role as a connector. Lord Mark is merely "civil" to her, and Mrs. Lowder views her sentimentally as a miraculously restored old friend, kept "in lavender and pink paper." Her main function in the scene is as the catalyst for the friendship between Milly and Kate.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** There is no shift in her situation; she remains a static, pleasant presence who appreciates the experience on behalf of the group.</li></ul>

Lord Mark looked at her to-day in particular
as if to wring from her a confession
that she had originally done him injustice;
and he was entitled to whatever there might be
in it of advantage or merit that his intention really
in a manner took effect: he cared about something,
that is, after all, sufficiently to make her
feel absurdly as if she <i>were</i> confessing—all the
while it was quite the case that neither justice
nor injustice was what had been in question between
them. He had presented himself at the hotel,
had found her and had found Susan Shepherd at
home, had been "civil" to Susan—it was just that
shade, and Susan's fancy had fondly caught it; and
then had come again and missed them, and then had
come and found them once more: besides letting
them easily see that if it hadn't by this time been the
end of everything—which they could feel in the exhausted
air, that of the season at its last gasp—the
places they might have liked to go to were such as
they would have had only to mention. Their feeling
was—or at any rate their modest general plea—that
there was no place they would have liked to go to;
there was only the sense of finding they liked, wherever
they were, the place to which they had been
brought. Such was highly the case as to their current
consciousness—which could be indeed, in an
equally eminent degree, but a matter of course; impressions
this afternoon having by a happy turn of
their wheel been gathered for them into a splendid
cluster, an offering like an armful of the rarest
flowers. They were in presence of the offering—they
had been led up to it; and if it had been still
their habit to look at each other across distances for
increase of unanimity his hand would have been silently
named between them as the hand applied to the
wheel. He had administered the touch that, under
light analysis, made the difference—the difference of
their not having lost, as Susie on the spot and at
the hour phrased it again and again, both for herself
and for such others as the question might concern,
so beautiful and interesting an experience; the difference
also, in fact, of Mrs. Lowder's not having
lost it either, though it was with Mrs. Lowder, superficially,
they had come, and though it was further
with that lady that our young woman was directly
engaged during the half-hour or so of her most
agreeably inward response to the scene.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Lord Mark focused on her that day, as if trying to force her to admit she'd wronged him. He acted as though he deserved something, a benefit or reward, from what had happened, as if his intention had actually mattered. He cared enough about the situation to make her feel foolish, as if she were confessing something, even though their relationship hadn't been about fairness or unfairness. He'd shown up at the hotel, found her and Susan Shepherd at home, and been "polite" to Susan – just that little bit of charm had caught Susan's attention. He'd returned, missed them, and then found them again. He also made it clear that if it wasn't the very end of the social season, which they all felt in the weary atmosphere, the places they might have wanted to go were places they could have easily suggested. They felt – or at least, their usual humble position was – that they didn't want to go anywhere. They simply enjoyed where they were, wherever they'd been brought. This was especially true of how they were feeling at that moment. The afternoon's experiences had, by a lucky turn, come together beautifully, like a stunning bouquet of rare flowers. They were appreciating this gift, they'd been led to it. If they still relied on shared glances to confirm their agreement, they would silently credit him for making it all happen. His influence had, upon closer inspection, made the difference – the difference of not having missed, as Susan kept saying to herself and anyone who would listen, such a wonderful and engaging experience. He'd also prevented Mrs. Lowder from missing it, even though they'd superficially come with Mrs. Lowder, and even though the young woman was directly occupied with Mrs. Lowder during the half-hour or so of her most pleasant inward enjoyment of the scene.</i></p></div>

<div class="original-text">
<p>
The great historic house had, for Milly, beyond
terrace and garden, as the centre of an almost extravagantly
grand Watteau-composition, a tone as
of old gold kept "down" by the quality of the air,
summer full-flushed, but attuned to the general perfect
taste. Much, by her measure, for the previous
hour, appeared, in connection with this revelation of
it, to have happened to her—a quantity expressed in
introductions of charming new people, in walks
through halls of armour, of pictures, of cabinets, of
tapestry, of tea-tables, in an assault of reminders
that this largeness of style was the sign of <i>appointed</i>
felicity. The largeness of style was the great containing
vessel, while everything else, the pleasant
personal affluence, the easy, murmurous welcome,
the honoured age of illustrious host and hostess, all
at once so distinguished and so plain, so public and
so shy, became but this or that element of the infusion.
The elements melted together and seasoned
the draught, the essence of which might have struck
the girl as distilled into the small cup of iced coffee
she had vaguely accepted from somebody, while a
fuller flood, somehow, kept bearing her up—all the
freshness of response of her young life the freshness
of the first and only prime. What had perhaps
brought on just now a kind of climax was the fact
of her appearing to make out, through Aunt Maud,
what was really the matter. It couldn't be less than
a climax for a poor shaky maiden to find it put to
her of a sudden that she herself was the matter—for
that was positively what, on Mrs. Lowder's part, it
came to. Everything was great, of course, in great
pictures, and it was doubtless precisely a part of the
brilliant life—since the brilliant life, as one had faintly
figured it, clearly <i>was</i> humanly led—that all impressions
within its area partook of its brilliancy;
still, letting that pass, it fairly stamped an hour as
with the official seal for one to be able to take in so
comfortably one's companion's broad blandness.
"You must stay among us—you must stay; anything
else is impossible and ridiculous; you don't
know yet, no doubt—you can't; but you will soon
enough: you can stay in <i>any</i> position." It had been
as the murmurous consecration to follow the murmurous
welcome; and even if it were but part of
Aunt Maud's own spiritual ebriety—for the dear
woman, one could see, was spiritually "keeping"
the day—it served to Milly, then and afterwards, as
a high-water mark of the imagination.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>For Milly, the grand old house, extending beyond the terrace and garden, was the heart of a scene that resembled an elaborate painting by Watteau. The atmosphere had the muted richness of antique gold, softened by the summer air, which was vibrant but in perfect harmony with the overall elegance. A great deal had happened to her in the past hour, connected to this realization of the house’s significance. There were introductions to delightful new people, tours through rooms filled with suits of armor, paintings, elaborate display cabinets, tapestries, and tea tables. These experiences were a barrage of reminders that this grand style was a sign of future happiness.</i></p><p><i>The grand style was the central element, the main container. Everything else – the comfortable wealth, the warm welcome, the respected age of her famous hosts, who were both refined and unpretentious, public yet reserved – became components of this atmosphere. These elements blended and flavored the overall feeling, the core of which might have felt concentrated in the small cup of iced coffee she’d casually accepted from someone. Meanwhile, a broader sense of support sustained her – the fresh responsiveness of her young life, at its peak.</i></p><p><i>What had possibly triggered a sort of peak moment was the fact that she realized, through Aunt Maud, what the real issue was. It was a definite climax for a nervous, young woman to suddenly understand that *she* was the problem—that’s exactly what Mrs. Lowder’s words implied. Everything was, of course, magnificent, reflected in the great paintings. And undoubtedly, since a brilliant life was, as she had imagined it, a human experience, all the impressions within its sphere took on its brilliance.</i></p><p><i>Still, overlooking that, it really marked the hour as official when one could accept her companion’s broad, pleasant assurance. "You must stay with us – you must stay; anything else is impossible and ridiculous. You don't know yet, of course – you can't, but you will soon enough. You can stay in any role." It was the whispered blessing following the whispered welcome. And even if it was just part of Aunt Maud's own slightly intoxicated happiness—because she was clearly enjoying the day—it served Milly, then and later, as a high point of her imagination.</i></p></div>

It was to be the end of the short parenthesis which
had begun but the other day at Lancaster Gate with
Lord Mark's informing her that she was a "success"—the
key thus again struck; and though no
distinct, no numbered revelations had crowded in,
there had, as we have seen, been plenty of incident
for the space and the time. There had been thrice
as much, and all gratuitous and genial—if, in portions,
not exactly hitherto <i>the</i> revelation—as three
unprepared weeks could have been expected to produce.
Mrs. Lowder had improvised a "rush" for
them, but out of elements, as Milly was now a little
more freely aware, somewhat roughly combined.
Therefore if at this very instant she had her reasons
for thinking of the parenthesis as about to close—reasons
completely personal—she had on behalf of
her companion a divination almost as deep. The
parenthesis would close with this admirable picture,
but the admirable picture still would show Aunt
Maud as not absolutely sure either if she herself were
destined to remain in it. What she was doing,
Milly might even not have escaped seeming to see,
was to talk herself into a sublimer serenity while she
ostensibly talked Milly. It was fine, the girl fully
felt, the way she did talk <i>her,</i> little as, at bottom, our
young woman needed it or found other persuasions
at fault. It was in particular during the minutes of
her grateful absorption of iced coffee—qualified by
a sharp doubt of her wisdom—that she most had in
view Lord Mark's relation to her being there, or at
least to the question of her being amused at it. It
wouldn't have taken much by the end of five minutes
quite to make her feel that this relation was charming.
It might, once more, simply have been that
everything, anything, was charming when one was so
justly and completely charmed; but, frankly, she had
not supposed anything so serenely sociable could define
itself between them as the friendly understanding
that was at present somehow in the air. They were,
many of them together, near the marquee that had
been erected on a stretch of sward as a temple of refreshment
and that happened to have the property—which
was all to the good of making Milly think
of a "durbar"; her iced coffee had been a consequence
of this connection, in which, further, the
bright company scattered about fell thoroughly into
place. Certain of its members might have represented
the contingent of "native princes"—familiar,
but scarce the less grandly gregarious term!—and
Lord Mark would have done for one of these even
though for choice he but presented himself as a
supervisory friend of the family. The Lancaster
Gate family, he clearly intended, in which he included
its American recruits, and included above all Kate
Croy—a young person blessedly easy to take care of.
She knew people, and people knew her, and she was
the handsomest thing there—this last a declaration
made by Milly, in a sort of soft mid-summer madness,
a straight skylark-flight of charity, to Aunt
Maud.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>This was supposed to be the end of the brief interlude that had begun just the other day at Lancaster Gate when Lord Mark told her she was a "success"—the key had been struck again. Although there hadn't been any clear, distinct revelations, there had been plenty of events for the time they'd had. There had been even more, all of it free and friendly—though perhaps not entirely revelatory—than one would have expected from just three weeks. Mrs. Lowder had arranged a "rush" of activities for them, but as Milly was starting to realize, the elements were somewhat haphazardly thrown together. So, if she now felt that this interlude was about to end—for completely personal reasons—she also had a strong sense of what her companion was thinking. The interlude would end with this wonderful gathering, but even here, Aunt Maud still seemed unsure if she herself would stay involved. Milly might even have sensed that Aunt Maud was essentially talking herself into a greater calm while ostensibly talking to Milly. It was impressive, Milly thought, the way Aunt Maud spoke to her, even though, deep down, Milly didn't really need the advice and wasn't finding other arguments compelling. It was especially while she gratefully sipped her iced coffee—though with a slight doubt about her own judgment—that she most considered Lord Mark's interest in her being there, or at least the question of whether she was amused by it. Within five minutes, it wouldn't have taken much to make her feel that his interest was charming. It might simply have been that everything, anything, was charming when one was so truly and completely charmed, but, frankly, she hadn't expected such a serenely social connection to develop between them, such as the friendly understanding that was currently in the air. Many of them were gathered near the marquee that had been set up on the lawn as a place for refreshments, and it happened to make Milly think of a "durbar" [a formal gathering], which led her to order iced coffee, and also made the bright company scattered about fit perfectly into the scene. Certain members of the group might have represented the contingent of "native princes"—a familiar, yet still impressively grand term!—and Lord Mark would have been one of them, even though he preferred to present himself as a supportive friend of the family. He clearly intended to include the Lancaster Gate family in this, which meant including its American newcomers, and above all, Kate Croy—a young woman who was blessedly easy to look after. Kate knew people, and people knew her, and she was the most beautiful person there—this was a declaration Milly made to Aunt Maud, in a sort of soft, summer-like moment of pure generosity.</i></p></div>

<p>
Kate had, for her new friend's eyes, the extraordinary
and attaching property of appearing at a given
moment to show as a beautiful stranger, to cut her
connections and lose her identity, letting the imagination
for the time make what it would of them—make
her merely a person striking from afar, more
and more pleasing as one watched, but who was
above all a subject for curiosity. Nothing could
have given her, as a party to a relation, a greater
freshness than this sense—which sprang up at its
own hours—of being as curious about her as if one
hadn't known her. It had sprung up, we have gathered,
as soon as Milly had seen her after hearing
from Mrs. Stringham of her knowledge of Merton
Densher; she had <i>looked</i> then other and, as Milly
knew the real critical mind would call it, more objective;
and our young woman had foreseen it of
her, on the spot, that she would often look so again.
It was exactly what she was doing this afternoon;
and Milly, who had amusements of thought that
were like the secrecies of a little girl playing with
dolls when conventionally "too big," could almost
settle to the game of what one would suppose her,
how one would place her, if one didn't know her.
She became thus, intermittently, a figure conditioned
only by the great facts of aspect, a figure to be waited
for, named and fitted. This was doubtless but a
way of feeling that it was of her essence to be peculiarly
what the occasion, whatever it might be, demanded
when its demand was highest. There were
probably ways enough, on these lines, for such a consciousness;
another of them would be, for instance,
to say that she was made for great social uses. Milly
was not wholly sure that she herself knew what great
social uses might be—unless, as a good example,
exerting just that sort of glamour in just that sort
of frame were one of them: she would have fallen
back on knowing sufficiently that they existed at all
events for her friend. It imputed a primness, all
round, to be reduced but to saying, by way of a translation
of one's amusement, that she was always so
<i>right</i>—since that, too often, was what the <i>insupportables</i>
themselves were; yet it was, in overflow to
Aunt Maud, what she had to content herself withal—save
for the lame enhancement of saying she was
lovely. It served, all the same, the purpose, strengthened
the bond that for the time held the two ladies
together, distilled in short its drop of rose-colour for
Mrs. Lowder's own view. That was really the view
Milly had, for most of the rest of the occasion, to
give herself to immediately taking in; but it didn't
prevent the continued play of those swift cross-lights,
odd beguilements of the mind, at which we
have already glanced.

Mrs. Lowder herself found it enough simply to
reply, in respect to Kate, that she was indeed a luxury
to take about the world: she expressed no
more surprise than that at her "rightness" to-day.
Wasn't it by this time sufficiently manifest that it
was precisely as the very luxury she was proving
that she had, from far back, been appraised and
waited for? Crude elation, however, might be kept
at bay, and the circumstance none the less demonstrated
that they were all swimming together in the
blue. It came back to Lord Mark again, as he
seemed slowly to pass and repass and conveniently
to linger before them; he was personally the note
of the blue—like a suspended skein of silk within
reach of the broiderer's hand. Aunt Maud's free-moving
shuttle took a length of him at rhythmic intervals;
and one of the intermixed truths that flickered
across to Milly was that he ever so consentingly
knew he was being worked in. This was almost like
an understanding with her at Mrs. Lowder's expense,
which she would have none of; she wouldn't
for the world have had him make any such point as
that he wouldn't have launched them at Matcham—or
whatever it was he <i>had</i> done—only for Aunt
Maud's <i>beaux yeux.</i> What he had done, it would
have been guessable, was something he had for some
time been desired in vain to do; and what they were
all now profiting by was a change comparatively sudden,
the cessation of hope delayed. What had
caused the cessation easily showed itself as none of
Milly's business; and she was luckily, for that matter,
in no real danger of hearing from him directly
that her individual weight had been felt in the scale.
Why then indeed was it an effect of his diffused but
subdued participation that he might absolutely have
been saying to her "Yes, let the dear woman take
her own tone? Since she's here she may stay," he
might have been adding—"for whatever she can
make of it. But you and I are different." Milly
knew <i>she</i> was different in truth—his own difference
was his own affair; but also she knew that, after all,
even at their distinctest, Lord Mark's "tips" in this
line would be tacit. He practically placed her—it
came round again to that—under no obligation
whatever. It was a matter of equal ease, moreover,
her letting Mrs. Lowder take a tone. She might
have taken twenty—they would have spoiled nothing.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Mrs. Lowder simply said, about Kate, that she was a luxury to have around. She wasn't surprised by Kate's "perfection" that day. Wasn't it clear by now that Kate was valued and anticipated precisely *because* she was a luxury? Any obvious excitement could be kept under wraps, but the situation still showed that they were all on the same page. Lord Mark kept circling back, lingering nearby. He was the epitome of their shared goal – like a silken thread waiting to be woven. Aunt Maud, with her constant maneuvering, was subtly incorporating him into her plan. Milly realized that he was willingly cooperating, almost as if he knew he was being used. This felt almost like a secret agreement at Mrs. Lowder's expense, and Milly wanted none of it. She wouldn't have wanted him to imply that he only helped them, by launching them at Matcham or whatever he'd done, because Aunt Maud wanted it. What he had done, one could assume, was something he'd been asked to do for a while; and what they were now benefiting from was a relatively sudden shift, the end of a long wait. What caused this change was none of Milly's business, and she was lucky not to have to hear from him directly that her influence had been noticed.</i></p><p><i>Still, it felt like his unspoken contribution was that he might as well have been saying to her, "Yes, let the dear woman have her say. Since she’s here, she can stay," and adding, "for whatever she can get out of it. But you and I are different." Milly knew that she *was* different – his own differences were his own concern. But she also knew that, even at their most discreet, Lord Mark's unspoken opinions on the matter would remain subtle. Essentially, he was making it clear, again, that she owed him nothing. It was equally easy for her to allow Mrs. Lowder to set the tone. She could have taken twenty different tones – it wouldn't have changed a thing.</i></p></div>

"You must stay on with us; you <i>can,</i> you know,
in any position you like; any, any, <i>any,</i> my dear
child"—and her emphasis went deep. "You must
make your home with us; and it's really open to you
to make the most beautiful one in the world. You
mustn't be under a mistake—under any of any sort;
and you must let us all think for you a little, take
care of you and watch over you. Above all you must
help me with Kate, and you must stay a little <i>for</i>
her; nothing for a long time has happened to me so
good as that you and she should have become friends.
It's beautiful; it's great; it's everything. What
makes it perfect is that it should have come about
through our dear delightful Susie, restored to me,
after so many years, by such a miracle. No—that's
more charming to me than even your hitting it off
with Kate. God has been good to one—positively;
for I couldn't, at my age, have made a new friend—undertaken,
I mean, out of whole cloth, the real
thing. It's like changing one's bankers—after fifty:
one doesn't do that. That's why Susie has been
kept for me, as you seem to keep people in your wonderful
country, in lavender and pink paper—coming
back at last as straight as out of a fairy-tale and with
you as an attendant fairy." Milly hereupon replied
appreciatively that such a description of herself made
her feel as if pink paper were her dress and lavender
its trimming; but Aunt Maud was not to be deterred
by a weak joke from keeping it up. Her interlocutress
could feel besides that she kept it up in perfect
sincerity. She was somehow at this hour a very
happy woman, and a part of her happiness might
precisely have been that her affections and her views
were moving as never before in concert. Unquestionably
she loved Susie; but she also loved Kate
and loved Lord Mark, loved their funny old host and
hostess, loved every one within range, down to the
very servant who came to receive Milly's empty iceplate—down,
for that matter, to Milly herself, who
was, while she talked, really conscious of the enveloping
flap of a protective mantle, a shelter with the
weight of an eastern carpet. An eastern carpet, for
wishing-purposes of one's own, was a thing to be on
rather than under; still, however, if the girl should
fail of breath it wouldn't be, she could feel, by Mrs.
Lowder's fault. One of the last things she was
afterwards to recall of this was Aunt Maud's going
on to say that she and Kate must stand together because
together they could do anything. It was for
Kate of course she was essentially planning; but the
plan, enlarged and uplifted now, somehow required
Milly's prosperity too for its full operation, just as
Milly's prosperity at the same time involved Kate's.
It was nebulous yet, it was slightly confused, but it
was unmistakably free and genial, and it made our
young woman understand things Kate had said of
her aunt's possibilities as well as characterisations
that had fallen from Susan Shepherd. One of the
most frequent on the lips of the latter had been that
dear Maud was a natural force.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>"You absolutely have to stay with us. You can, you know. You can have any role you want, any, any, any, my dear. She really emphasized that. You need to make this your home, and honestly, you could make the most wonderful home imaginable. Please don't misunderstand me, not in any way. You should let us help you with some things, take care of you, and look out for you. Most importantly, you need to help me with Kate, and you have to stay for her sake. It's been the best thing to happen to me in a long time that you and she have become friends. It's beautiful, it's amazing, it's everything. What makes it perfect is that it happened because of our dear, delightful Susie, who came back to me after all these years, it was a miracle! No, that's even more delightful to me than you and Kate getting along so well. I've been blessed, truly.

But Aunt Maud wasn't going to let a silly joke stop her. Milly could also tell that Aunt Maud was being completely sincere. Somehow, at that moment, she was a very happy woman, and part of her happiness might have been that her feelings and her goals were working together like never before. She undoubtedly loved Susie, but she also loved Kate and Lord Mark, loved their funny old hosts, loved everyone around her, even the servant who took Milly's empty ice cream plate – even Milly herself, who, as she talked, felt the comforting weight of a protective shield, like being wrapped in a heavy, oriental rug. While you'd rather be on top of an oriental rug than under it, still, if the girl needed help, it wouldn't be because of Mrs. Lowder, she could feel. One of the last things Milly would later remember from this conversation was Aunt Maud saying that she and Kate needed to stick together because they could do anything together. She was essentially planning for Kate, of course, but the plan, expanded and elevated now, somehow required Milly's success as well, and Milly's success at the same time involved Kate's. It was unclear yet, a little confusing, but it was undoubtedly open and friendly, and it made Milly understand things Kate had said about her aunt's capabilities and the things that Susan Shepherd had said. One of Susan Shepherd's most common sayings had been that dear Maud was a force of nature.</i></p></div>

<div class="summary-box">
<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Lord Mark approaches a girl, Milly, and tells her about a portrait in the house that resembles her. He leads her inside to see it. As they walk, they are repeatedly stopped by other guests who greet Lord Mark.</p><p>They arrive at the Bronzino portrait. Milly looks at it through tears and says, "I shall never be better than this." She clarifies to Lord Mark that she means the afternoon has been perfect. They discuss the resemblance between her and the woman in the painting.</p><p>Kate Croy arrives with Lord and Lady Aldershaw. They all agree on the resemblance. Kate tells Milly she looks superb. Lady Aldershaw begins to invite Milly somewhere, but Lord Mark interrupts and leads Lady Aldershaw away. Lord Aldershaw looks at the painting, then follows them, leaving Milly and Kate alone.</p><p>Milly asks Kate to do her a secret service: to go with her to a doctor's appointment the next day. She says the plan is to deceive her companion, Susan Shepherd, to avoid worrying her. Milly explains she has an appointment with a doctor, Sir Luke Strett, and asks Kate to promise absolute silence. Kate asks what is wrong, and Milly says that is what she wants to find out. After a brief discussion, Kate agrees to accompany her.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Initial Presentation:** Milly is presented as a passive, observant young woman who is the object of intense social curiosity. She is aware that a reputation as a "rich young American" precedes her and accepts being put on display with a detached "uplifted assurance." She is initially led by Lord Mark, trusting him and absorbing the social scene around her.</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** Her situation shifts dramatically upon seeing the Bronzino portrait. Her passivity gives way to a profound and sudden emotional vulnerability, moving her to tears and prompting the fatalistic declaration, "I shall never be better than this." A second shift occurs with Kate’s arrival; Milly moves from being an object of social attention to an active agent of her own affairs. She seizes the initiative, confiding in Kate about a secret visit to a doctor and arranging for her help, thus revealing a hidden, serious anxiety about her health.</li>
<li>*Lord Mark**</li>
<li>**Initial Presentation:** He is presented as a smooth, socially adept, and protective guide. He orchestrates the encounter with Milly, steers her through the crowd with practiced ease, and shields her from unwanted social overtures. He is perceptive in noticing Milly's resemblance to the portrait but completely misinterprets her deep emotional reaction to it, revealing a lack of emotional depth.</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** His situation shifts from being Milly’s primary companion and protector to being sidelined. After Kate Croy arrives and takes control, he is seen strolling away with another guest, his central role in the scene effectively ended.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Initial Presentation:** Kate appears as a confident and socially powerful figure. She arrives and immediately re-frames the scene around herself, confirming the portrait's likeness and managing the other guests with "subtle operation." Her initial reaction to Milly’s request for help is playful and worldly ("Then I'm your woman").</li>
<li>**Immediate Shift:** She quickly shifts from a social peer to a confidante entrusted with a serious secret. Her demeanor changes from light amusement to direct, concerned inquiry ("What in the world is the matter with you?"). By the end of the passage, she has displaced Lord Mark and established a new, deeply intimate and secretive relationship with Milly.</li></ul>

<p>
A prime reason, we must add, why sundry impressions
were not to be fully present to the girl till later
on was that they yielded at this stage, with an effect
of sharp supersession, to a detached quarter of an
hour—her only one—with Lord Mark. "Have you
seen the picture in the house, the beautiful one that's
so like you?"—he was asking that as he stood before
her; having come up at last with his smooth
intimation that any wire he had pulled and yet
wanted not to remind her of wasn't quite a reason for
his having no joy at all.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Another important reason why she didn't fully understand all the things she was experiencing until later was that those feelings were immediately replaced by a brief, special moment – her only one – with Lord Mark. "Have you seen that painting in the house, the beautiful one that looks so much like you?" he asked, standing in front of her. He had finally approached her, vaguely suggesting that whatever he'd done behind the scenes, which he preferred not to mention, wasn't the sole reason he seemed unhappy.</i></p></div>

<p>
"I've been through rooms and I've seen pictures.
But if I'm 'like' anything so beautiful as most of
them seemed to me——!" It needed in short for
Milly some evidence, which he only wanted to supply.
She was the image of the wonderful Bronzino,
which she must have a look at on every ground.
He had thus called her off and led her away; the
more easily that the house within was above all what
had already drawn round her its mystic circle.
Their progress, meanwhile, was not of the straightest;
it was an advance, without haste, through innumerable
natural pauses and soft concussions, determined
for the most part by the appearance before
them of ladies and gentlemen, singly, in couples, in
groups, who brought them to a stand with an inveterate
"I say, Mark." What they said she never
quite made out; it was their all so domestically knowing
him, and his knowing them, that mainly struck
her, while her impression, for the rest, was but of
fellow-strollers more vaguely afloat than themselves,
supernumeraries mostly a little battered, whether as
jaunty males or as ostensibly elegant women. They
might have been moving a good deal by a momentum
that had begun far back, but they were still
brave and personable, still warranted for continuance
as long again, and they gave her, in especial
collectively, a sense of pleasant voices, pleasanter
than those of actors, of friendly, empty words and
kind, lingering eyes. The lingering eyes looked her
over, the lingering eyes were what went, in almost
confessed simplicity, with the pointless "I say,
Mark "; and what was really most sensible of all
was that, as a pleasant matter of course, if she didn't
mind, he seemed to suggest their letting people, poor
dear things, have the benefit of her.

</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>I've seen some pretty amazing places and artwork. But if I'm even *close* to being as beautiful as most of those things seemed to me...!" Basically, Milly needed some proof, and he was happy to provide it. She was like that amazing Bronzino painting, and she needed to see it for herself. He'd pulled her away, which was easy because the house itself was already drawing her in.</i></p><p><i>Their walk wasn't exactly direct; it was a slow journey with lots of natural stops and casual bumps, mostly because they kept running into people – ladies and gentlemen, alone, in pairs, in groups – who would stop them with a casual "Hey, Mark." She never quite understood what they were saying; what struck her was how familiar they all were with him, and his familiarity with them. As for the others, they seemed like casual tourists, a bit worn, both the cheerful men and the seemingly elegant women. They might have been carried along by something that started long ago, but they were still charming and presentable, and seemed like they could keep going forever. Collectively, they gave her a feeling of pleasant voices, even nicer than actors' voices, and friendly, meaningless chatter with kind, lingering gazes. Those lingering eyes looked her over, and those lingering eyes were a part of that pointless "Hey, Mark." And what was really striking was that, in a friendly way, he seemed to suggest that if she didn't mind, they'd let these poor dears have the benefit of seeing her.</i></p></div>

The odd part was that he made her herself believe,
for amusement, in the benefit, measured by him in
mere manner—for wonderful, of a truth, was, as a
means of expression, his slightness of emphasis—that
her present good-nature conferred. It was, as
she could easily see, a mild common carnival of
good-nature—a mass of London people together, of
sorts and sorts, but who mainly knew each other and
who, in their way, did, no doubt, confess to curiosity.
It had gone round that she was there; questions
about her would be passing; the easiest thing was
to run the gauntlet with <i>him</i>—just as the easiest
thing was in fact to trust him generally. Couldn't
she know for herself, passively, how little harm they
meant her?—to that extent that it made no difference
whether or not he introduced them. The
strangest thing of all for Milly was perhaps the uplifted
assurance and indifference with which she
could simply give back the particular bland stare that
appeared in such cases to mark civilisation at its
highest. It was so little her fault, this oddity of
what had "gone round" about her, that to accept
it without question might be as good a way as another
of feeling life. It was inevitable to supply the
probable description—that of the awfully rich young
American who was so queer to behold, but nice, by
all accounts, to know; and she had really but one
instant of speculation as to fables or fantasies perchance
originally launched. She asked herself once
only if Susie could, inconceivably, have been blatant
about her; for the question, on the spot, was really
blown away for ever. She knew in fact on the spot
and with sharpness just why she had "elected"
Susan Shepherd: she had had from the first hour the
conviction of her being precisely the person in the
world least possibly a trumpeter. So it wasn't their
fault, it wasn't their fault, and anything might happen
that would, and everything now again melted
together, and kind eyes were always kind eyes—if it
were never to be worse than that! She got with her
companion into the house; they brushed, beneficently,
past all their accidents. The Bronzino was, it
appeared, deep within, and the long afternoon light
lingered for them on patches of old colour and waylaid
them, as they went, in nooks and opening
vistas.

It was all the while for Milly as if Lord Mark had
really had something other than this spoken pretext
in view; as if there were something he wanted to say
to her and were only—consciously yet not awkwardly,
just delicately—hanging fire. At the same time
it was as if the thing had practically been said by the
moment they came in sight of the picture; since
what it appeared to amount to was "Do let a fellow
who isn't a fool take care of you a little." The thing
somehow, with the aid of the Bronzino, was done;
it hadn't seemed to matter to her before if he were
a fool or no; but now, just where they were, she
liked his not being; and it was all moreover none
the worse for coming back to something of the same
sound as Mrs. Lowder's so recent reminder. She
too wished to take care of her—and wasn't it, <i>à peu
près,</i> what all the people with the kind eyes were
wishing? Once more things melted together—the
beauty and the history and the facility and the splendid
midsummer glow: it was a sort of magnificent
maximum, the pink dawn of an apotheosis, coming
so curiously soon. What in fact befell was that, as
she afterwards made out, it was Lord Mark who said
nothing in particular—it was she herself who said
all. She couldn't help that—it came; and the reason
it came was that she found herself, for the first moment,
looking at the mysterious portrait through
tears. Perhaps it was her tears that made it just
then so strange and fair—as wonderful as he had
said: the face of a young woman, all magnificently
drawn, down to the hands, and magnificently
dressed; a face almost livid in hue, yet handsome in
sadness and crowned with a mass of hair rolled back
and high, that must, before fading with time, have
had a family resemblance to her own. The lady in
question, at all events, with her slightly Michaelangelesque
squareness, her eyes of other days, her
full lips, her long neck, her recorded jewels, her brocaded
and wasted reds, was a very great personage—only
unaccompanied by a joy. And she was dead,
dead, dead. Milly recognised her exactly in words
that had nothing to do with her. "I shall never be
better than this."

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly felt like Lord Mark had a hidden motive, something more than just the reason he gave for being there. It was as if he wanted to tell her something, but he was holding back, not awkwardly, but deliberately and carefully. At the same time, it was as if he’d already said what he wanted to say, simply by showing her the painting. It was as if he was saying, "Let someone who isn’t an idiot look after you a little." Somehow, with the help of the Bronzino painting, it was accomplished. It hadn't seemed to matter to her before whether he was a fool or not, but now, standing there, she was glad he wasn't. And it was all the better because it echoed Mrs. Lowder's recent offer of help. She also wanted to take care of Milly – and wasn't that what everyone with kind eyes seemed to want? Once again, everything blended together: the beauty, the history, the ease, and the gorgeous summer light. It was a kind of overwhelming peak, the start of something amazing, and it was happening so quickly. In reality, as she realized later, Lord Mark said nothing of significance. It was she who said everything. She couldn’t help it – it just came out. And the reason it came out was that, for the first time, she was looking at the mysterious portrait through tears. Perhaps it was her tears that made it seem so strange and beautiful then—just as wonderful as he had said: the face of a young woman, exquisitely painted down to the hands, dressed in magnificent clothes; a face almost pale, but handsome in its sadness, and framed by a mass of hair piled high, that, before it faded with age, must have looked a little like her own. The woman in the painting, with her slightly angular features, her eyes of another time, her full lips, her long neck, her jewels, her faded red brocade, was a very important person—but she had no joy. And she was dead, dead, dead. Milly understood her perfectly, expressing her understanding in words that had nothing to do with the painting’s subject.

He hadn't understood. She was before the picture,
but she had turned to him, and she didn't care
if, for the minute, he noticed her tears. It was probably
as good a moment as she should ever have with
him. It was perhaps as good a moment as she
should have with any one, or have in any connection

Lady Aldershaw meanwhile looked at Milly quite
as if Milly had been the Bronzino and the Bronzino
only Milly. "Superb, superb. Of course I had
noticed you. It is wonderful," she went on with her
back to the picture, but with some other eagerness
which Milly felt gathering, directing her motions
now. It was enough—they were introduced, and
she was saying "I wonder if you could give us the
pleasure of coming——" She was not fresh, for
she was not young, even though she denied at every
pore that she was old; but she was vivid and much
bejewelled for the midsummer daylight; and she
was all in the palest pinks and blues. She didn't
think, at this pass, that she could "come" anywhere—Milly
didn't; and she already knew that somehow
Lord Mark was saving her from the question. He
had interposed, taking the words out of the lady's
mouth and not caring at all if the lady minded. That
was clearly the right way to treat her—at least for
him; as she had only dropped, smiling, and then
turned away with him. She had been dealt with—it
would have done an enemy good. The gentleman
still stood, a little helpless, addressing himself to the
intention of urbanity as if it were a large loud
whistle; he had been signing sympathy, in his way,
while the lady made her overture; and Milly had,
in this light, soon arrived at their identity. They
were Lord and Lady Aldershaw, and the wife was
the clever one. A minute or two later the situation
had changed, and she knew it afterwards to have
been by the subtle operation of Kate. She was herself
saying that she was afraid she must go now if
Susie could be found; but she was sitting down on
the nearest seat to say it. The prospect, through
opened doors, stretched before her into other rooms,
down the vista of which Lord Mark was strolling
with Lady Aldershaw, who, close to him and much
intent, seemed to show from behind as peculiarly
expert. Lord Aldershaw, for his part, had been left
in the middle of the room, while Kate, with her back
to him, was standing before her with much sweetness
of manner. The sweetness was all for <i>her;</i> she had
the sense of the poor gentleman's having somehow
been handled as Lord Mark had handled his wife.
He dangled there, he shambled a little; then he bethought
himself of the Bronzino, before which, with
his eyeglass, he hovered. It drew from him an odd,
vague sound, not wholly distinct from a grunt, and
a "Humph—most remarkable!" which lighted
Kate's face with amusement. The next moment he
had creaked away, over polished floors, after the
others, and Milly was feeling as if <i>she</i> had been rude.
But Lord Aldershaw was in every way a detail, and
Kate was saying to her that she hoped she wasn't
ill.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Meanwhile, Lady Aldershaw was looking at Milly as if Milly *was* the famous Bronzino painting, and the painting was *just* Milly. "Wonderful, wonderful. Of course, I've noticed you. It's marvelous," she continued, with her back to the painting, but with a different kind of enthusiasm that Milly sensed was building and directing her actions. That was enough—they were introduced, and Lady Aldershaw was saying, "I wonder if you could join us—" She wasn't youthful, because she wasn't young, even though she clearly refused to admit she was old; but she was lively and heavily jeweled for the summer afternoon, and she was dressed entirely in pale pinks and blues. Milly didn't think she could "join" anything at this point; and she already knew that somehow Lord Mark was saving her from the invitation. He had interrupted, taking the words right out of Lady Aldershaw's mouth and not caring if she minded at all. That was obviously the best way to handle her—at least for him; she just smiled briefly and then walked away with him. She’d been dealt with, which would have pleased an enemy. The gentleman, Lord Aldershaw, still stood there, a bit lost, attempting to be polite as if it were a loud whistle; he had been silently expressing sympathy while his wife made her offer; and Milly had quickly figured out who they were. They were Lord and Lady Aldershaw, and the wife was the smart one. A few minutes later, the situation had changed, and she later realized it was because of Kate’s skillful intervention. Milly herself was saying she had to leave if she could find Susie; but she was still sitting down as she said it. The view through open doorways led to other rooms, and down the hallway, Lord Mark was strolling with Lady Aldershaw, who seemed to be very focused and from behind looked particularly experienced. Lord Aldershaw, meanwhile, had been left alone in the middle of the room, while Kate, facing Milly and with her back to him, was being very charming. All the charm was directed at Milly; she got the feeling that the poor gentleman had been handled in the same way Lord Mark had handled his wife. He just stood there, a little unsteady; then he remembered the Bronzino painting, which he then examined with his monocle. It caused him to make a strange, vague sound, not quite a grunt, and a "Humph—most remarkable!" which made Kate smile. The next moment, he had shuffled away, across the polished floors, after the others, and Milly felt like she had been impolite.

Thus it was that, aloft there in the great gilded
historic chamber and the presence of the pale personage
on the wall, whose eyes all the while seemed
engaged with her own, she found herself suddenly
sunk in something quite intimate and humble and to
which these grandeurs were strange enough witnesses.
It had come up, in the form in which she
had had to accept it, all suddenly, and nothing about
it, at the same time, was more marked than that she
had in a manner plunged into it to escape from something
else. Something else, from her first vision of
her friend's appearance three minutes before, had
been present to her even through the call made by

<i>there,</i> she was more and more uncomfortably

spring of its own, with every renewal of their meeting.
"Is it the way she looks to <i>him?"</i> she asked
herself—the perversity being that she kept in remembrance
that Kate was known to him. It wasn't
a fault in Kate—nor in him assuredly; and she had
a horror, being generous and tender, of treating
either of them as if it had been. To Densher himself
she couldn't make it up—he was too far away;

Her maid wasn't suitable, and Susie was too good. Kate had listened, mostly with amusement. "And I'm the perfect choice, how convenient! Too good for what?"</i></p></div>

Kate fixed her with deep eyes. "What in the
world is the matter with you?" It had inevitably
a sound of impatience, as if it had been a challenge
really to produce something; so that Milly felt her
for the moment only as a much older person, standing
above her a little, doubting the imagined ailments,
suspecting the easy complaints, of ignorant
youth. It somewhat checked her, further, that the
matter with her was what exactly as yet she wanted
knowledge about; and she immediately declared, for
conciliation, that if she were merely fanciful Kate
would see her put to shame. Kate vividly uttered,
in return, the hope that, since she could come out and
be so charming, could so universally dazzle and interest,
she wasn't all the while in distress or in anxiety—didn't
believe herself, in short, to be in any
degree seriously menaced. "Well, I want to make
out—to make out!" was all that this consistently
produced. To which Kate made clear answer:
"Ah then, let us by all means!"

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate looked at her intently. "What's wrong?" Her voice sounded impatient, almost like she was daring Milly to explain. Milly felt Kate was much older and looked down on her, skeptical of her supposed problems and dismissing the complaints of someone young and inexperienced. This made Milly hesitate, because she didn't fully understand what was bothering her. She quickly tried to appease Kate by saying that if she was just imagining things, Kate would call her out on it. Kate responded eagerly, hoping that since Milly seemed so charming, captivating, and engaging, she wasn't actually suffering or worried, and that she wasn't seriously in trouble. Milly could only manage to say, "Well, I want to figure it out – to understand!" Kate simply replied, "Okay, let's do it then!"</i></p></div>

It made a moment during which her companion
waited on her word; partly as if from a yearning,
shy but deep, to have her case put to her just as Kate
was struck by it; partly as if the hint of pity were
already giving a sense to her whimsical "shot," with
Lord Mark, at Mrs. Lowder's first dinner. Exactly
this—the handsome girl's compassionate manner,
her friendly descent from her own strength—was

<div class="summary-box">
<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Kate accompanies Milly to a doctor's appointment. The doctor, Sir Luke Strett, has only ten minutes but schedules another appointment with Milly in a day or two. After the brief meeting, Milly tells Kate that the doctor is a "dear," that he will take care of her, and that she is to see him again. Milly decides to attend the next appointment by herself and asks Kate for her discretion. While waiting for their carriage, Milly reassures Kate that she is satisfied and feels "absolved."</p><p>Two days later, Milly goes to her second appointment alone. The doctor asks if she was accompanied. She explains that she is alone, with no living family members. After examining her, the doctor gives her a small prescription and says he will visit her at her home in a few days. He instructs her to leave London after his visit and says she can go to the continent. He says he will "follow you up." Before she leaves, Milly asks if she will suffer, and he answers, "Not a bit." When she asks if she will live, he replies that this is what he is trying to persuade her to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="analysis-box">
<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Milly is presented as a highly perceptive, romantic, and emotionally volatile young woman who is isolated and grappling with a serious, unnamed affliction. She interprets her experiences through a rich inner monologue, transforming a brief medical appointment into a profound, almost spiritual event. She feels she is "loosely rattling" through life and craves a sense of firmness and order, even if it comes from a grim diagnosis.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Milly enters the doctor's office anxious and overwhelmed. In ten minutes, her situation shifts dramatically: she feels an immediate, deep sense of trust and relief, as if she has been "absolved." She leaves the first meeting feeling she has gained an "absolute possession" in the form of the doctor's friendship. By the second meeting, this feeling solidifies into a paradoxical comfort; she accepts that his kindness implies her situation is "bad," yet finds a strange stability in being "found out" by his genius.</li>
<li>*Sir Luke Strett (The Doctor)**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Sir Luke is portrayed through Milly’s eyes as a "great man" who is authoritative yet gentle. He projects an aura of profound, intuitive knowledge, seeming to understand Milly’s condition and character with minimal questioning ("He can tell. He knows"). He is described as looking like a "general" and a "bishop," combining firmness with a capacity for kindness that Milly finds comforting.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Initially presented as a busy professional with only ten minutes to spare, his role quickly shifts to that of a dedicated, almost paternalistic guide. He commits to seeing Milly again, visiting her, and even following her abroad, moving beyond a standard doctor-patient relationship into one of "unlimited interest."</li>
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
<li>**Presentation:** Kate is presented as a pragmatic and skeptical friend. Her concern is direct and physical, comparing Milly’s consultation to a tooth extraction ("Is it out?"). She presses for concrete facts ("what does he say?") and is suspicious of the doctor's rapid, intuitive assessment. Her friendship has a transactional quality; she demands "the truth" in exchange for her discretion.</li>
<li>**Situational Shift:** Kate begins as Milly's close companion, accompanying her to the appointment. Her situation shifts when Milly decides to see the doctor alone the next time, effectively moving Kate from an active participant to an outsider who is now only granted information at Milly's discretion.</li></ul>

<p>
What it really came to, on the morrow, this first
time—the time Kate went with her—was that the
great man had, a little, to excuse himself; had, by a
rare accident—for he kept his consulting-hours in
general rigorously free—but ten minutes to give her;
ten mere minutes which he yet placed at her service
in a manner that she admired even more than she
could meet it: so crystal-clean the great empty cup
of attention that he set between them on the table.
He was presently to jump into his carriage, but he
promptly made the point that he must see her again,
see her within a day or two; and he named for her
at once another hour—easing her off beautifully too
even then in respect to her possibly failing of justice
to her errand. The minutes affected her in fact as
ebbing more swiftly than her little army of items
could muster, and they would probably have gone
without her doing much more than secure another
hearing, had it not been for her sense, at the last,
that she had gained above all an impression. The
impression—all the sharp growth of the final few
moments—was neither more nor less than that she
might make, of a sudden, in quite another world,
another straight friend, and a friend who would
moreover be, wonderfully, the most appointed, the
most thoroughly adjusted of the whole collection,
inasmuch as he would somehow wear the character
scientifically, ponderably, proveably—not just loosely
and sociably. Literally, furthermore, it wouldn't
really depend on herself, Sir Luke Strett's friendship,
in the least; perhaps what made her most stammer
and pant was its thus queerly coming over her
that she might find she had interested him even beyond
her intention, find she was in fact launched in
some current that would lose itself in the sea of science.
At the same time that she struggled, however,
she also surrendered; there was a moment at which
she almost dropped the form of stating, of explaining,
and threw herself, without violence, only with
a supreme pointless quaver that had turned, the next
instant, to an intensity of interrogative stillness,
upon his general goodwill. His large, settled face,
though firm, was not, as she had thought at first,
hard; he looked, in the oddest manner, to her fancy,
half like a general and half like a bishop, and she
was soon sure that, within some such handsome
range, what it would show her would be what was
good, what was best for her. She had established,
in other words, in this time-saving way, a relation
with it; and the relation was the special trophy that,
for the hour, she bore off. It was like an absolute
possession, a new resource altogether, something
done up in the softest silk and tucked away under
the arm of memory. She hadn't had it when she
went in, and she had it when she came out; she had
it there under her cloak, but dissimulated, invisibly
carried, when smiling, smiling, she again faced Kate
Croy. That young lady had of course awaited her
in another room, where, as the great man was to absent
himself, no one else was in attendance; and she
rose for her with such a face of sympathy as might
have graced the vestibule of a dentist. "Is it out?"
she seemed to ask as if it had been a question of a
tooth; and Milly indeed kept her in no suspense
at all.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Here’s what happened the next day, the first time Kate went with her. The important man had to apologize a little because, in a rare accident (he usually kept his appointment times strictly), he only had ten minutes to spare. He gave her those ten minutes, and she admired the way he did it. He gave her his complete, undivided attention, like a clear glass set between them. He was about to leave in his carriage, but he insisted on seeing her again within a day or two. He even immediately scheduled another meeting, subtly reassuring her that she wouldn't necessarily be able to fully explain everything in their short time. The minutes flew by faster than she could present her arguments, and she probably wouldn't have accomplished much beyond setting up another appointment, if she hadn’t gotten the strong feeling at the end that she had made an impression.</i></p><p><i>This impression, which really solidified in the last few moments, was simply that she might find a new, straightforward friend in a completely different world. Moreover, this friend would be the most suitable and well-suited of all her acquaintances, because he would understand his role scientifically, thoroughly, and demonstrably, not just casually and socially. Furthermore, her connection with Sir Luke Strett wouldn't really depend on her at all. Perhaps what made her the most nervous was the strange realization that she might have captured his interest beyond her intentions, that she was in fact being carried along in a current that would lead her to the sea of scientific research.</i></p><p><i>However, even as she struggled, she also gave in. There was a moment when she nearly stopped trying to explain herself and instead, without any force, but with a supreme, pointless trembling that instantly transformed into a deep, questioning stillness, she relied on his general kindness. His large, settled face, though strong, wasn’t, as she had first thought, harsh. To her, he looked strangely like a mix of a general and a bishop. She quickly realized that within that handsome range, he would show her what was good and what was best for her. In other words, in this quick meeting, she had established a connection with him, and that connection was the special prize she took away with her. It was like an absolute treasure, a new resource, something wrapped in the softest silk and stored away in her memory. She didn’t have it when she went in, but she had it when she came out.

It just pulled her friend up, for even while they
talked—at least it was one of the reasons—she stood
there suddenly, irrelevantly, in the light of her <i>other</i>
identity, the identity she would have for Mr. Densher.
This was always, from one instant to another,
an incalculable light, which, though it might go off
faster than it came on, necessarily disturbed. It
sprang, with a perversity all its own, from the fact
that, with the lapse of hours and days, the chances
themselves that made for his being named continued
so oddly to fail. There were twenty, there were
fifty, but none of them turned up. This, in particular,
was of course not a juncture at which the least
of them would naturally be present; but it would
make, none the less, Milly saw, another day practically
all stamped with avoidance. She saw in a
quick glimmer, and with it all Kate's unconsciousness;
and then she shook off the obsession. But it
had lasted long enough to qualify her response. No,
she had shown Kate how she trusted her; and that,
for loyalty, would somehow do. "Oh, dear thing,
now that the ice is broken I shan't trouble <i>you</i> again."

It arose, with its own strange logic, from the fact that as time went on, the possibilities that might have led to him being mentioned continued to disappear. There were twenty possibilities, then fifty, but none of them materialized. Of course, this wasn't an occasion when any of them would normally appear, but it made, Milly realized, another day essentially marked by avoiding the topic. She understood this in a flash, along with Kate's unawareness, and then she pushed the thought away. But it had lasted long enough to change her reaction. Yes, she had shown Kate how much she trusted her, and that, as a sign of loyalty, would be enough. "Oh, darling, now that we've talked about it, I won't bother you about it anymore."</i></p></div>

Outside, before the door, on the wide pavement

their carriage, which Milly had kept, completed a
further turn of exercise, engaged in by the coachman
for reasons of his own. The footman was there,

Milly met her look now without a thought of anything
but the spoken. She had ceased to be Mr.
Densher's image; she was all her own memento
and she was none the less fine. Still, still, what had
passed was a fair bargain, and it would do. "Of

"Oh—doctors!" Milly said. "But I hope," she
added, "he didn't like me too much." Then as if
to escape a little from her friend's deeper sounding,
or as impatient for the carriage, not yet in sight, her
eyes, turning away, took in the great stale square.
As its staleness, however, was but that of London
fairly fatigued, the late hot London with its dance
all danced and its story all told, the air seemed a
thing of blurred pictures and mixed echoes, and an
impression met the sense—an impression that broke,
the next moment, through the girl's tightened lips.

She was to have found this preference, two days
later, abundantly justified; and yet when, in prompt
accordance with what had passed between them, she
reappeared before her distinguished friend—that
character having, for him, in the interval, built itself
up still higher—the first thing he asked her was
whether she had been accompanied. She told him,
on this, straightway, everything; completely free at
present from her first embarrassment, disposed even—as
she felt she might become—to undue volubility,
and conscious moreover of no alarm from his thus
perhaps wishing that she had not come alone. It
was exactly as if, in the forty-eight hours that had
passed, her acquaintance with him had somehow increased,
and his own knowledge in particular received
mysterious additions. They had been together,
before, scarce ten minutes; but the relation,
the one the ten minutes had so beautifully created,
was there to take straight up: and this not, on his
own part, from mere professional heartiness, mere
bedside manner, which she would have disliked—much
rather from a quiet, pleasant air in him of having
positively asked about her, asked here and there
and found out. Of course he couldn't in the least
have asked, or have wanted to; there was no source
of information to his hand, and he had really needed
none: he had found out simply by his genius—and
found out, she meant, literally everything. Now
she knew not only that she didn't dislike this—the
state of being found out about; but that, on the contrary,
it was truly what she had come for, and that,
for the time at least, it would give her something firm
to stand on. She struck herself as aware, aware as
she had never been, of really not having had from
the beginning anything firm. It would be strange
for the firmness to come, after all, from her learning
in these agreeable conditions that she was in some
way doomed; but above all it would prove how little
she had hitherto had to hold her up. If she was now
to be held up by the mere process—since that was
perhaps on the cards—of being let down, this would
only testify in turn to her queer little history. <i>That</i>
sense of loosely rattling had been no process at all;
and it was ridiculously true that her thus sitting there
to see her life put into the scales represented her first
approach to the taste of orderly living. Such was
Milly's romantic version—that her life, especially by
the fact of this second interview, <i>was</i> put into the
scales; and just the best part of the relation established
might have been, for that matter, that the
great grave charming man knew, had known at once,
that it was romantic, and in that measure allowed
for it. Her only doubt, her only fear, was whether
he perhaps wouldn't even take advantage of her being
a little romantic to treat her as romantic altogether.
This doubtless was her danger with him;
but she should see, and dangers in general meanwhile
dropped and dropped.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Two days later, she would find her choice completely validated. When she went back to see her distinguished friend—a man whose reputation had grown in the meantime—right away he asked her if she had come with anyone. She immediately told him everything, now completely over her initial awkwardness, even possibly inclined to talk too much, and not at all worried that he seemed to wish she hadn't come alone. It was as if their acquaintance had deepened in those two days, and as if he had gained some mysterious knowledge about her. They had only spent ten minutes together before, but the connection they'd formed was still strong. He wasn't just being friendly in a professional way, like a doctor with a good bedside manner, which she wouldn't have liked. Instead, he seemed genuinely interested in her, as if he'd asked around about her and found things out. Of course, he couldn't have actually asked anyone, and he didn't need to. He just knew, simply by his intuition—and by "knew," she meant literally everything. Now, she realized that she didn't mind being "found out." On the contrary, that's what she had come for, and it would give her something stable to rely on, at least for a while. She realized she had never actually had anything stable to begin with. It would be strange if this stability came from discovering that she was in some way doomed, but it would also show how little she had had to support her until now. If she were now to be supported by the very process of being brought down—since that was possibly the plan—it would just confirm her unusual past. That feeling of being adrift had been no support at all. It was ridiculous, but true, that sitting there, having her life assessed, was her first experience of a structured life. That was Milly's romantic idea: that her life was being weighed in the balance, especially because of this second meeting. The best part of their relationship might be that the great, serious, charming man knew, from the start, that it was romantic, and was taking that into account. Her only doubt, her only fear, was that he might take advantage of her being a little romantic, and treat her as a completely romantic person. That was probably her danger with him, but she'd see, and for the moment, any other concerns fell away.</i></p></div>

The very place, at the end of a few minutes, the
commodious, "handsome" room, far back in the fine
old house, soundless from position, somewhat sallow
with years of celebrity, somewhat sombre even at
midsummer—the very place put on for her a look of
custom and use, squared itself solidly round her as
with promises and certainties. She had come forth
to see the world, and this then was to be the world's
light, the rich dusk of a London "back," these the
world's walls, those the world's curtains and carpet.
She should be intimate with the great bronze clock
and mantel-ornaments, conspicuously presented in
gratitude and long ago; she should be as one of the
circle of eminent contemporaries, photographed,
engraved, signatured, and in particular framed and
glazed, who made up the rest of the decoration, and
made up as well so much of the human comfort; and
while she thought of all the clean truths, unfringed,
unfingered, that the listening stillness, strained into
pauses and waits, would again and again, for years,
have kept distinct, she also wondered what she would
eventually decide upon to present in gratitude. She
would give something better at least than the brawny
Victorian bronzes. This was precisely an instance
of what she felt he knew of her before he had done
with her: that she was secretly romancing at that
rate, in the midst of so much else that was more
urgent, all over the place. So much for her secrets
with him, none of which really required to be
phrased. It would have been, for example, a secret
for her from any one else that without a dear lady
she had picked up just before coming over she
wouldn't have a decently near connection, of any
sort, for such an appeal as she was making, to put
forward: no one in the least, as it were, to produce
for respectability. But <i>his</i> seeing it she didn't mind a
scrap, and not a scrap either his knowing how she
had left the dear lady in the dark. She had come
alone, putting her friend off with a fraud: giving
a pretext of shops, of a whim, of she didn't know
what—the amusement of being for once in the
streets by herself. The streets by herself were new
to her—she had always had in them a companion, or
a maid; and he was never to believe, moreover, that
she couldn't take full in the face anything he might
have to say. He was softly amused at her account
of her courage; though he yet showed it somehow
without soothing her too grossly. Still, he did want
to know whom she had. Hadn't there been a lady
with her on Wednesday?

She had come to experience the world, and this, then, was to be the world's ambiance, the rich twilight of a London "back room," these the world's walls, those the world's curtains and carpet. She would become accustomed to the large bronze clock and the ornaments on the mantelpiece, prominently displayed as gifts from long ago. She would become a part of the circle of famous contemporaries, immortalized in photographs, engravings, signatures, and framed pictures, which made up the rest of the decor and provided so much of the room's comfort. And as she considered all the simple, untouched truths that the listening silence, stretched into pauses and expectations, would preserve for years to come, she also wondered what she would eventually offer in return, what she would give as her gift of gratitude. It would be something better than those bulky Victorian bronzes, at least. This was exactly the kind of thing he knew about her before he even spoke: that she was secretly indulging in fantasies, even amidst more pressing matters, a habit she embraced everywhere she went.

It didn't take much computation, but she nevertheless
had to think a moment, conscious as she was
that he distinctly <i>would</i> want to fill out his notion
of her—even a little, as it were, to warm the air for
her. That, however—and better early than late—he
must accept as of no use; and she herself felt for
an instant quite a competent certainty on the subject
of any such warming. The air, for Milly Theale,
was, from the very nature of the case, destined never
to rid itself of a considerable chill. This she could
tell him with authority, if she could tell him nothing
else; and she seemed to see now, in short, that it
would importantly simplify. "Yes, it makes another;
but they all together wouldn't make—well,
I don't know what to call it but the difference. I
mean when one is—really alone. I've never seen
anything like the kindness." She pulled up a minute
while he waited—waited again as if with his reasons
for letting her, for almost making her, talk. What
she herself wanted was not, for the third time, to
cry, as it were, in public. She <i>had</i> never seen anything
like the kindness, and she wished to do it justice;
but she knew what she was about, and justice
was not wronged by her being able presently to stick
to her point. "Only one's situation is what it is.
It's me it concerns. The rest is delightful and useless.
Nobody can really help. That's why I'm by
myself to-day. I <i>want</i> to be—in spite of Miss Croy,
who came with me last. If you can help, so much
the better and also of course if one can, a little,
one's self. Except for that—you and me doing our
best—I like you to see me just as I am. Yes, I like
it—and I don't exaggerate. Shouldn't one, at the
start, show the worst—so that anything after that
may be better? It wouldn't make any real difference—it
<i>won't</i> make any, anything that may happen
won't—to any one. Therefore I feel myself, this
way, with you, just as I am; and—if you do in the
least care to know—it quite positively bears me up."
She put it as to his caring to know, because his
manner seemed to give her all her chance, and the
impression was there for her to take. It was strange
and deep for her, this impression, and she did, accordingly,
take it straight home. It showed him—showed
him in spite of himself—as allowing, somewhere
far within, things comparatively remote,
things in fact quite, as she would have said, outside,
delicately to weigh with him; showed him as interested,
on her behalf, in other questions beside the
question of what was the matter with her. She accepted
such an interest as regular in the highest type
of scientific mind—his <i>being</i> the even highest, magnificently
because otherwise, obviously, it wouldn't
be there; but she could at the same time take it as
a direct source of light upon herself, even though
that might present her a little as pretending to equal
him. Wanting to know more about a patient than
how a patient was constructed or deranged couldn't
be, even on the part of the greatest of doctors, anything
but some form or other of the desire to let
the patient down easily. When that was the case
the reason, in turn, could only be, too manifestly,
pity; and when pity held up its tell-tale face like
a head on a pike, in a French revolution, bobbing
before a window, what was the inference but that
the patient was bad? He might say what he would
now—she would always have seen the head at the
window; and in fact from this moment she only
wanted him to say what he would. He might say
it too with the greater ease to himself as there wasn't
one of her divinations that—as her own—he would
in any way put himself out for. Finally, if he was
making her talk she <i>was</i> talking; and what it could,
at any rate, come to for him was that she wasn't
afraid. If he wanted to do the dearest thing in the
world for her he would show her he believed she
wasn't; which undertaking of hers—not to have
misled him—was what she counted at the moment
as her presumptuous little hint to him that she was
as good as himself. It put forward the bold idea
that he could really <i>be</i> misled; and there actually
passed between them for some seconds a sign, a sign
of the eyes only, that they knew together where they
were. This made, in their brown old temple of
truth, its momentary flicker; then what followed it
was that he had her, all the same, in his pocket; and
the whole thing wound up, for that consummation,
with its kind dim smile. Such kindness was wonderful
with such dimness; but brightness—that even
of sharp steel—was of course for the other side of
the business, and it would all come in for her in
one way or another. "Do you mean," he asked,
"that you've no relations at all?—not a parent, not
a sister, not even a cousin nor an aunt?"
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She didn't need to think hard, but she still had to pause for a moment. She knew he wanted to understand her better, even to try and make her feel more comfortable. But she knew that was pointless. She had to accept that he couldn't help her, and it was better to face it now. She felt a certain certainty about her situation. For Milly Theale, the situation was such that she would always feel a deep chill. She could tell him this, if nothing else. And she realized it would simplify things. "Yes, it creates another problem," she said. "But all those problems together don't equal... I don't know what to call it, but it's the difference. I mean when someone is truly alone. I've never experienced anything like the kindness I've received." She stopped for a moment while he waited—he seemed to be giving her space to talk. She didn't want to break down in front of him again. She'd never known such kindness, and she wanted to acknowledge it, but she knew what she was doing, and acknowledging it didn't mean she couldn't stick to the point. "My situation is what it is. It concerns me. Everything else is wonderful, but doesn't change anything. No one can truly help. That's why I'm here alone today. I want to be—despite Miss Croy being with me last time. If you can help, great, and if I can help myself a little, even better. But beyond that—just you and me doing our best—I want you to see me as I am. Yes, I like it—and I'm not exaggerating. Shouldn't you start by showing the worst—so that anything after that might be better? It won't make a difference, anything that may happen won't affect anyone. So, I feel comfortable being myself with you. And—if you care—it really helps me."</i></p><p><i>She phrased it this way because he seemed to be giving her the opportunity, and she sensed that he was listening. It was a strange and profound impression, and she took it to heart. He was allowing, deep down, for things she considered remote, things that were, in fact, outside of her situation, to influence him. He was interested, on her behalf, in things beyond her illness. She considered such interest normal for the most brilliant scientific minds—his being the most brilliant because, if it weren't, it wouldn't be there. At the same time, she could see this as shedding light on herself, even if it made her appear to be trying to equal him. Wanting to know more about a patient than just how their body or mind functions could only be, even for the greatest doctor, a way of softening the blow for the patient. In that case, the reason, too obvious, was pity. When pity showed itself, like a head on a stake from a French revolution, bobbing in the window, what could she conclude but that she was in a bad way? He could say whatever he wanted now—she would always see the head in the window. From this moment on, she just wanted him to say what he thought. He could speak freely because he wouldn't be trying to help her in any way. She was talking because he was making her talk. The main thing for him was that she wasn't afraid. If he wanted to do the best thing for her, he would show her he believed she wasn't. Her intention not to mislead him was her way of hinting to him that she was as capable as he was. It suggested he could be wrong, and for a few seconds they exchanged a look that showed they understood each other. This created a moment of truth, then it was clear that she was essentially trapped in his process. It all ended with his kind, gentle smile. That kindness was wonderful, but the harsh truth was for the other side of this situation, and it would all come into play for her eventually.

"Ah, you do want to see some one!" she broke
out. "You want to get at some one who cares for
me." With which, however, as he simply met this
spontaneity in a manner to show that he had often
had it from young persons of her race, and that he
was familiar even with the possibilities of their
familiarity, she felt her freedom rendered vain by
his silence, and she immediately tried to think of the
most reasonable thing she could say. This would
be, precisely, on the subject of that freedom, which
she now quickly spoke of as complete. "That's of
course by itself a great boon; so please don't think
I don't know it. I can do exactly what I like—anything
in all the wide world. I haven't a creature to
ask—there's not a finger to stop me. I can shake
about till I'm black and blue. That perhaps isn't <i>all</i>
joy; but lots of people, I know, would like to try it."
He had appeared about to put a question, but then
had let her go on, which she promptly did, for she
understood him the next moment as having thus
taken it from her that her means were as great as
might be. She had simply given it to him so, and
this was all that would ever pass between them on
the odious head. Yet she couldn't help also knowing
that an important effect, for his judgment, or
at least for his amusement—which was his feeling,
since, marvellously, he did have feeling—was produced
by it. All her little pieces had now then fallen
together for him like the morsels of coloured glass
that used to make combinations, under the hand, in
the depths of one of the polygonal peepshows of
childhood. "So that if it's a question of my doing
anything under the sun that will help——!"

However, he just reacted as if he'd heard this kind of thing from young women like her before, and that he was used to their behavior. This made her feel like her freedom was pointless because of his silence, so she immediately tried to think of the most sensible thing to say. This was, of course, about that freedom, which she quickly described as complete. "That's a huge advantage, and please don't think I don't realize it. I can do whatever I want—anything in the whole world. I don't have anyone to answer to—no one to stop me. I can travel wherever I want. Maybe that's not always fun, but I know a lot of people would love to try it."</i></p><p><i>He seemed like he was about to ask a question, but then let her continue. She quickly understood that he was assuming she had as much money as possible. She'd simply given him that impression, and that was all that would be said about the subject. Still, she knew it would have an impact, either on his judgment or, at the very least, his amusement—which was his typical reaction, since he somehow had feelings. All her little actions had now clicked into place for him, like the pieces of colored glass that used to create images in those childhood toy kaleidoscopes.

"You'll <i>do</i> anything under the sun? Good." He
took that beautifully, ever so pleasantly, for what it
was worth; but time was needed—ten minutes or
so were needed on the spot—to deal even provisionally,
with the substantive question. It was convenient,
in its degree, that there was nothing she
wouldn't do; but it seemed also highly and agreeably
vague that she should have to do anything. They
thus appeared to be taking her, together, for the moment,
and almost for sociability, as prepared to proceed
to gratuitous extremities; the upshot of which
was in turn, that after much interrogation, auscultation,
exploration, much noting of his own sequences
and neglecting of hers, had duly kept up the vagueness,
they might have struck themselves, or may at
least strike us, as coming back from an undeterred
but useless voyage to the north pole. Milly was
ready, under orders, for the north pole; which fact
was doubtless what made a blinding anticlimax of her
friend's actual abstention from orders. "No," she
heard him again distinctly repeat it, "I don't want
you for the present to do anything at all; anything,
that is, but obey a small prescription or two that
will be made clear to you, and let me within a few
days come to see you at home."

It was helpful that she was willing to do anything, but also strangely unclear that she'd actually *have* to do anything. They seemed to be, for now, treating her like they could casually ask her to do anything, no matter how extreme. After a lot of questioning, checking things out, and focusing on his own thoughts while ignoring hers, they'd maintained the ambiguity, and they might have felt, or at least we might feel, like they were returning from a pointless trip to the North Pole. Milly was ready, willing to go to the North Pole, which made her friend's ultimate refusal to give her any instructions a huge letdown. "No," she heard him repeat clearly, "I don't want you to do anything right now.

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>After leaving a meeting, a woman walks alone through London without a set destination. She passes through unknown streets until she arrives at Regent's Park. She enters the park, finds an empty bench, and sits down to rest. After some time, she gets up and leaves.</p><p>For the next day or two, she deceives her companion, Susie.</p><p>That evening, her friend Kate Croy arrives at the hotel in a hansom cab. The woman, Milly, sees Kate arrive from a balcony, and they exchange nods and smiles. Kate comes up to the sitting-room and asks what the doctor said. Milly replies that it is "all right," that there is nothing to worry about, and that she can do as she likes. Kate kisses her. Milly elaborates that she is to travel and go to places for pleasure. She asks Kate to help her, and Kate agrees.</p>

<div class="analysis-box">
<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly**</li>
Milly is initially presented in a state of agitated excitement, energized by a "distinguished friend's" words. This propels her into a solitary walk through London, which she frames as a "great adventure," a military-like march into a new, uncertain life. Her situation shifts dramatically as she sits in Regent's Park. Her initial feeling of empowerment dissolves into physical and emotional exhaustion. Her thinking turns analytical and suspicious, leading her to reinterpret the friend's kindness not as encouragement, but as a "chilling" form of pity for a grave, unspoken condition. This realization transforms her from an adventurer into a "poor girl" facing a dire reality. In her final interaction, she undergoes another immediate shift, choosing to perform a role. Confronted with Kate’s vitality, she conceals her internal crisis and presents a facade of perfect health and freedom, actively creating a false narrative about her situation.
<li>*The "Distinguished Friend" (Doctor)**</li>
He is presented entirely through Milly’s shifting interpretations. Initially, he is an empowering figure whose advice to "be active" acts as a "final push" into a new life. As Milly’s mood sours, her perception of him changes. He becomes a man who is "bolstering" the weak, treating her with a "beneficent dishonesty" and a compassion she finds "divesting, denuding, exposing." He is less a character in his own right and more a catalyst for Milly's internal transformations.
<li>*Susan (Susie) Shepherd**</li>
Susan is portrayed as a companion whose defining characteristic is an almost reverent, "Byzantine" consideration for Milly. She is presented as someone who intentionally spares Milly from difficult questions, treating her with the deference due to a "princess." Her situation is that of an unwitting observer, kept at a distance by her own courtly manners, which Milly now uses to help conceal her true state.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li></ul>
Kate is presented as a figure of vibrant, direct, and uncomplicated health. Her arrival is energetic and her questioning is straightforward ("Well, what?"). She is characterized by her physical splendor and what Milly perceives as a "practical impeccability." Her situation is that of a confidante who is actively deceived. She immediately and enthusiastically accepts Milly's lie, her cheerful assumptions providing the perfect audience for Milly’s new performance of well-being.

<p>
She had gone out with these last words so in her
ears that when once she was well away—back this
time in the great square alone—it was as if some
instant application of them had opened out there before
her. It was positively, this effect, an excitement
that carried her on; she went forward into
space under the sense of an impulse received—an
impulse simple and direct, easy above all to act upon.
She was borne up for the hour, and now she knew
why she had wanted to come by herself. No one
in the world could have sufficiently entered into her
state; no tie would have been close enough to enable
a companion to walk beside her without some disparity.
She literally felt, in this first flush, that her
only company must be the human race at large,
present all round her, but inspiringly impersonal,
and that her only field must be, then and there, the
grey immensity of London. Grey immensity had
somehow of a sudden become her element; grey immensity
was what her distinguished friend had, for
the moment, furnished her world with and what the
question of "living," as he put it to her, living by
option, by volition, inevitably took on for its immediate
face. She went straight before her, without
weakness, altogether with strength; and still as she
went she was more glad to be alone, for nobody—not
Kate Croy, not Susan Shepherd either—would
have wished to rush with her as she rushed. She
had asked him at the last whether, being on foot,
she might go home so, or elsewhere, and he had replied
as if almost amused again at her extravagance:
"You're active, luckily, by nature—it's beautiful:
therefore rejoice in it. <i>Be</i> active, without folly—for
you're not foolish: be as active as you can and
as you like." That had been in fact the final push,
as well as the touch that most made a mixture of
her consciousness—a strange mixture that tasted at
one and the same time of what she had lost and what
had been given her. It was wonderful to her, while
she took her random course, that these quantities felt
so equal: she had been treated—hadn't she?—as if
it were in her power to live; and yet one wasn't
treated so—was one?—unless it came up, quite as
much, that one might die. The beauty of the bloom
had gone from the small old sense of safety—that
was distinct: she had left it behind her there forever.
But the beauty of the idea of a great adventure, a big
dim experiment or struggle in which she might,
more responsibly than ever before, take a hand, had
been offered her instead. It was as if she had had to
pluck off her breast, to throw away, some friendly
ornament, a familiar flower, a little old jewel, that
was part of her daily dress; and to take up and
shoulder as a substitute some queer defensive
weapon, a musket, a spear, a battle-axe conducive
possibly in a higher degree to a striking appearance,
but demanding all the effort of the military posture.
She felt this instrument, for that matter, already
on her back, so that she proceeded now in very truth
as a soldier on a march—proceeded as if, for her
initiation, the first charge had been sounded. She
passed along unknown streets, over dusty littery
ways, between long rows of fronts not enhanced by
the August light; she felt good for miles and only
wanted to get lost; there were moments at corners,
where she stopped and chose her direction, in which
she quite lived up to his injunction to rejoice that she
was active. It was like a new pleasure to have so
new a reason; she would affirm, without delay, her
option, her volition; taking this personal possession
of what surrounded her was a fair affirmation to
start with; and she really didn't care if she made
it at the cost of alarms for Susie. Susie would wonder
in due course "whatever," as they said at the
hotel, had become of her; yet this would be nothing
either, probably, to wonderments still in store.
Wonderments in truth, Milly felt, even now attended
her steps: it was quite as if she saw in people's eyes
the reflection of her appearance and pace. She
found herself moving at times in regions visibly not
haunted by odd-looking girls from New York, duskily
draped, sable-plumed, all but incongruously shod
and gazing about them with extravagance; she
might, from the curiosity she clearly excited in byways,
in side-streets peopled with grimy children
and costermongers carts, which she hoped were
slums, literally have had her musket on her shoulder,
have announced herself as freshly on the warpath.
But for the fear of overdoing this character she
would here and there have begun conversation, have
asked her way; in spite of the fact that, as that
would help the requirements of adventure, her way
was exactly what she wanted not to know. The
difficulty was that she at last accidentally found it;
she had come out, she presently saw, at the Regent's
Park, round which, on two or three occasions with
Kate Croy, her public chariot had solemnly rolled.
But she went into it further now; this was the real
thing; the real thing was to be quite away from the
pompous roads, well within the centre and on the
stretches of shabby grass. Here were benches and
smutty sheep; here were idle lads at games of ball,
with their cries mild in the thick air; here were wanderers,
anxious and tired like herself; here doubtless
were hundreds of others just in the same box.
Their box, their great common anxiety, what was it,
in this grim breathing-space, but the practical question
of life? They could live if they would; that
is, like herself, they had been told so; she saw them
all about her, on seats, digesting the information,
feeling it altered, assimilated, recognising it again
as something, in a slightly different shape, familiar
enough, the blessed old truth that they would live
if they could. All she thus shared with them made
her wish to sit in their company; which she so far
did that she looked for a bench that was empty, eschewing
a still emptier chair that she saw hard by
and for which she would have paid, with superiority,
a fee.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She was still hearing those last words. When she got far enough away, back in the big square all alone, it was as if their meaning had suddenly become clear. In fact, this feeling was an exciting one that pushed her forward. She entered the space with a sense of purpose – a simple, clear impulse that was easy to act on. She felt energized for the moment, and now she understood why she'd wanted to be alone. No one in the world could have fully understood her situation; no close relationship could allow a companion to walk beside her without some misunderstanding. She literally felt, in this first rush of emotion, that her only company must be the entire human race, present all around her but inspiringly impersonal, and that her only arena must be the gray vastness of London. That gray vastness had suddenly become her element. It was what her distinguished friend had, for the time being, provided her with, and what the question of "living," as he put it, living by choice and will, inevitably presented as its immediate challenge.</i></p><p><i>She walked straight ahead without weakness, full of strength. She was increasingly glad to be alone, because nobody—not Kate Croy, not Susan Shepherd—would have wanted to rush with her as she was rushing. She had asked him at the end whether she could walk home or go elsewhere, since she was on foot, and he had replied almost amused by her enthusiasm: "You're naturally active, which is wonderful. So, enjoy it. Be active, without being foolish—because you aren't. Be as active as you can and as you like." That had been the final push and the thing that most mixed up her thoughts – a strange mix that tasted of both what she'd lost and what she'd been given. It was amazing to her, as she wandered along, that these things felt so equal. She had been treated – hadn't she? – as if it were in her power to live. And yet, you wouldn't be treated like that – would you? – unless it was also clear that you might die. The beauty of security was gone. She had left it behind her forever. But instead, she'd been offered the beauty of the idea of a great adventure, a big experiment or struggle in which she could take part with more responsibility than ever before. It was as if she'd had to take off and throw away some friendly ornament, a familiar flower, a little old jewel that was part of her everyday appearance, and pick up and carry instead some strange defensive weapon, a musket, a spear, or a battle-axe. Those weapons could possibly make her appear more striking, but they required a soldier's effort.</i></p><p><i>She already felt this instrument on her back. She was proceeding as a soldier on a march, as if the first attack had begun. She walked through unknown streets, over dusty and littered pathways, between long rows of buildings not improved by the August light. She felt good for miles and just wanted to get lost. There were moments at corners, where she stopped and chose her direction, in which she completely lived up to his instruction to enjoy her activity. It was a new pleasure to have such a new reason. She would immediately declare her choice and her will. Taking personal ownership of what surrounded her was a fair declaration to start with. She didn't really care if she caused worry for Susie. Susie would eventually wonder what had happened to her, as they said at the hotel. But this wouldn't be anything compared to the other things she might have to deal with. Milly felt that wonderings truly accompanied her steps even now. It was as if she saw her appearance and the pace of her actions reflected in people's eyes. She found herself moving through areas where she saw few odd-looking girls from New York, darkly dressed with sable plumes. They seemed strangely shod and gazed around with extravagance. From the curiosity she clearly aroused in side streets populated by dirty children and costermongers' carts, which she hoped were slums, she could have literally had her musket on her shoulder and announced herself as newly on the warpath.</i></p><p><i>But, for fear of overdoing it, she resisted the urge to begin conversations and ask for directions. She actually didn't want to know the way, as that would help the adventure's requirements. The problem was that she eventually found it by accident. She had come out, she realized, in Regent's Park, which she'd visited with Kate Croy a few times in her carriage. But now she went further into it. This was the real thing. The real thing was to be away from the busy roads, deep within the center and on the stretches of worn grass. Here were benches and dirty sheep. Here were idle boys playing ball, their cries softened by the thick air. Here were wanderers, anxious and tired like herself. Doubtless, hundreds of others were in the same situation. What was their shared anxiety in this somber moment but the practical question of life? They could live if they chose; that is, they'd been told as much, just like her. She saw them all around her, on seats, absorbing the information, feeling it changed, integrated, recognizing it again as something slightly familiar, the old truth that they would live if they could. All she shared with them made her want to sit with them. She looked for an empty bench, avoiding a chair nearby that was even emptier and for which she would have had to pay a fee with a feeling of superiority.</i></p></div>

<p>
The last scrap of superiority had soon enough left
her, if only because she before long knew herself for
more tired than she had proposed. This and the
charm, after a fashion, of the situation in itself made
her linger and rest; there was a sort of spell in the
sense that nobody in the world knew where she was.
It was the first time in her life that this had happened;
somebody, everybody appeared to have
known before, at every instant of it, where she was;
so that she was now suddenly able to put it to herself
that that hadn't been a life. This present kind
of thing therefore might be—which was where precisely
her distinguished friend seemed to be wishing
her to come out. He wished her also, it was true,
not to make, as she was perhaps doing now, too much
of her isolation; at the same time however as he
clearly desired to deny her no decent source of interest.
He was interested—she arrived at that—in
her appealing to as many sources as possible; and it
fairly filtered into her, as she sat and sat, that he was
essentially propping her up. Had she been doing it
herself she would have called it bolstering—the bolstering
that was simply for the weak; and she
thought and thought as she put together the proofs
that it was as one of the weak he was treating her.
It was of course as one of the weak that she had gone
to him—but, oh, with how sneaking a hope that he
might pronounce her, as to all indispensables, a veritable
young lioness! What indeed she was really
confronted with was the consciousness that he had
not, after all, pronounced her anything: she nursed
herself into the sense that he had beautifully got out
of it. Did he think, however, she wondered, that
he could keep out of it to the end?—though, as she
weighed the question, she yet felt it a little unjust.
Milly weighed, in this extraordinary hour, questions
numerous and strange; but she had, happily, before
she moved, worked round to a simplification.
Stranger than anything, for instance, was the effect
of its rolling over her that, when one considered it,
he might perhaps have "got out" by one door but
to come in with a beautiful, beneficent dishonesty by
another. It kept her more intensely motionless
there that what he might fundamentally be "up to"
was some disguised intention of standing by her as a
friend. Wasn't that what women always said they
wanted to do when they deprecated the addresses of
gentlemen they couldn't more intimately go on with?
It was what they, no doubt, sincerely fancied they
could make of men of whom they couldn't make
husbands. And she didn't even reason that it was,
by a similar law, the expedient of doctors in general
for the invalids of whom they couldn't make patients:
she was somehow so sufficiently aware that
<i>her</i> doctor was—however fatuous it might sound—exceptionally
moved. This was the damning little
fact—if she could talk of damnation: that she could
believe herself to have caught him in the act of irrelevantly
liking her. She hadn't gone to him to be
liked, she had gone to him to be judged; and he was
quite a great enough man to be in the habit, as a
rule, of observing the difference. She could like
<i>him,</i> as she distinctly did—that was another matter;
all the more that her doing so was now, so obviously
for herself, compatible with judgment. Yet it
would have been all portentously mixed had not, as
we say, a final, merciful wave, chilling rather, but
washing clear, come to her assistance.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Her sense of being superior quickly faded, probably because she realized she was more exhausted than she'd admitted. This, along with a certain appeal to the situation itself, made her stay put and relax. There was something magical about knowing that no one in the world knew where she was. It was a first for her; it seemed as if, up to now, someone, everyone, had always known her whereabouts. Now she could finally admit to herself that what she’d experienced until now hadn’t been a real life. This new experience, then, might be the true thing—which was precisely the goal her distinguished friend seemed to be encouraging. He also, it was true, wished her not to dwell too much on her isolation, as she might be doing now, while clearly wanting to allow her every reasonable opportunity for interest. He was interested—she realized—in her drawing on as many sources of interest as possible; and it gradually dawned on her, as she sat and sat, that he was essentially supporting her. If she were the one doing it, she’d call it coddling—the kind of support reserved for the weak. And she thought and thought as she considered the evidence, concluding that he was treating her as one of the weak. Of course, that's how she had approached him—but with a secret hope that he might declare her a formidable, young woman! In reality, she was facing the realization that he hadn't declared her anything. She began to feel he had artfully avoided doing so. Did he think, she wondered, that he could avoid it indefinitely? Even as she considered the question, she felt it was a little unfair. During this extraordinary time, Milly wrestled with many strange questions, but thankfully, she reached a simplification before she moved. What was stranger than anything, for instance, was the realization that, considering it, he might have “got out” of one commitment only to come back in through another, with a kind, dishonest intent. It kept her rooted there as she considered whether his fundamental aim was a disguised plan to befriend her. Wasn't that what women always said they wanted when they rejected the advances of men they couldn't be more intimate with? It's what they sincerely thought they could make of men they couldn't make husbands. And she didn't even reason that it was, by a similar principle, the strategy of doctors in general toward the patients they couldn't cure. She was somehow very much aware that her doctor was—however ridiculous it sounded—exceptionally moved by her. This was the damning fact—if she could speak of damnation: that she could believe she had caught him in the act of irrationally liking her. She hadn't gone to him to be liked; she had gone to him to be judged; and he was a great enough man to be in the habit, as a rule, of understanding the difference. She could like him, as she distinctly did—that was another matter; all the more so because her feeling for him was now, obviously for herself, compatible with judgment.

It came, of a sudden, when all other thought was
spent. She had been asking herself why, if her case
was grave—and she knew what she meant by that—he
should have talked to her at all about what she
might with futility "do"; or why on the other
hand, if it were light, he should attach an importance
to the office of friendship. She had him, with her
little lonely acuteness—as acuteness went during the
dog-days in the Regent's Park—in a cleft stick: she
either mattered, and then she was ill; or she didn't
matter, and then she was well enough. Now he was
"acting," as they said at home, as if she did matter—until
he should prove the contrary. It was too
evident that a person at his high pressure must keep
his inconsistencies, which were probably his highest
amusements, only for the very greatest occasions.
Her prevision, in fine, of just where she should catch
him furnished the light of that judgment in which
we describe her as daring to indulge. And the
judgment it was that made her sensation simple.
He <i>had</i> distinguished her—that was the chill. He
hadn't known—how could he?—that she was devilishly
subtle, subtle exactly in the manner of the suspected,
the suspicious, the condemned. He in fact
confessed to it, in his way, as to an interest in her
combinations, her funny race, her funny losses, her
funny gains, her funny freedom, and, no doubt,
above all, her funny manners—funny, like those of
Americans at their best, without being vulgar, legitimating
amiability and helping to pass it off. In his
appreciation of these redundancies he dressed out for
her the compassion he so signally permitted himself
to waste; but its operation for herself was as directly
divesting, denuding, exposing. It reduced her to
her ultimate state, which was that of a poor girl
with her rent to pay for example—staring before
her in a great city. Milly had her rent to pay, her
rent for her future; everything else but how to meet
it fell away from her in pieces, in tatters. This was
the sensation the great man had doubtless not purposed.
Well, she must go home, like the poor girl,
and see. There might after all be ways; the poor
girl too would be thinking. It came back for that
matter perhaps to views already presented. She
looked about her again, on her feet, at her scattered,
melancholy comrades—some of them so melancholy
as to be down on their stomachs in the grass, turned
away, ignoring, burrowing; she saw once more,
with them, those two faces of the question between
which there was so little to choose for inspiration.
It was perhaps superficially more striking that one
could live if one would; but it was more appealing,
insinuating, irresistible, in short, that one would live
if one could.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It hit her suddenly, when she’d exhausted all other thoughts. She’d been wondering why, if her situation was serious – and she knew what she meant by that – he would have talked to her at all about things she might fruitlessly “do.” Alternatively, if it wasn’t serious, why would he make so much of their friendship? Her cleverness, as sharp as it got during the lazy summer days in Regent's Park, had him trapped. Either she mattered, and was therefore ill, or she didn’t matter, and was fine. Now, he was “acting,” as they’d say back home, as if she did matter – until he proved otherwise. It was obvious someone so important saved their inconsistencies, which were probably his greatest entertainment, for the most important situations. Her ability to predict his behavior provided the foundation for her daring judgment. And it was that judgment that made her feeling simple. He'd singled her out – that was the cold truth. He didn’t know – how could he? – that she was incredibly perceptive, perceptive in the same way as someone suspicious, under suspicion, or condemned. He actually admitted it, in his own way, by showing interest in her complex personality, her quirks, her failures, her successes, her freedom, and, undoubtedly, above all, her amusing behavior – amusing, like the best Americans, without being crude, justifying friendliness and helping to gloss it over. In acknowledging these aspects, he displayed the compassion he so easily allowed himself to feel; but for her, the effect was directly stripping away everything, leaving her exposed. It reduced her to her core state, that of a poor woman with her rent to pay – staring out at the great city. Milly had to pay her rent, her rent for her future; everything else but how to manage that crumbled away. This was the sensation the great man surely hadn’t intended. Well, she had to go home, like that poor woman, and figure it out. Maybe there were options; the poor woman would be thinking too. It possibly went back to ideas that had already been brought up. She looked around again, standing, at her scattered, sad companions – some so sad they were lying face down in the grass, avoiding the world, hiding; she saw again, with them, the two sides of the dilemma, both equally uninspiring. It was perhaps more immediately striking that one could live if one tried; but it was more appealing, seductive, irresistible, that one *would* live if one could.</i></p></div>

She found after this, for the day or two, more
amusement than she had ventured to count on in
the fact, if it were not a mere fancy, of deceiving
Susie; and she presently felt that what made the
difference was the mere fancy—as this <i>was</i> one—of
a countermove to her great man. His taking on
himself—should he do so—to get at her companion
made her suddenly, she held, irresponsible, made any
notion of her own all right for her; though indeed
at the very moment she invited herself to enjoy this
impunity she became aware of new matter for surprise,
or at least for speculation. Her idea would
rather have been that Mrs. Stringham would have
looked at her hard—her sketch of the grounds of
her long, independent excursion showing, she could
feel, as almost cynically superficial. Yet the dear
woman so failed, in the event, to avail herself of any
right of criticism that it was sensibly tempting, for
an hour, to wonder if Kate Croy had been playing
perfectly fair. Hadn't she possibly, from motives
of the highest benevolence, promptings of the finest
anxiety, just given poor Susie what she would have
called the straight tip? It must immediately be
mentioned, however, that, quite apart from a remembrance
of the distinctness of Kate's promise, Milly,
the next thing, found her explanation in a truth that
had the merit of being general. If Susie, at this
crisis, suspiciously spared her, it was really that
Susie was always suspiciously sparing her—yet occasionally,
too, with portentous and exceptional
mercies. The girl was conscious of how she dropped
at times into inscrutable, impenetrable deferences—attitudes
that, though without at all intending it,
made a difference for familiarity, for the ease of intimacy.
It was as if she recalled herself to manners,
to the law of court-etiquette—which last note above
all helped our young woman to a just appreciation.
It was definite for her, even if not quite solid, that
to treat her as a princess was a positive need of her
companion's mind; wherefore she couldn't help it if
this lady had her transcendent view of the way the
class in question were treated. Susan had read history,
had read Gibbon and Froude and Saint-Simon;
she had high-lights as to the special allowances made
for the class, and, since she saw them, when young,
as effete and overtutored, inevitably ironic and infinitely
refined, one must take it for amusing if she
inclined to an indulgence verily Byzantine. If one
<i>could</i> only be Byzantine!—wasn't <i>that</i> what she insidiously
led one on to sigh? Milly tried to oblige
her—for it really placed Susan herself so handsomely
to be Byzantine now. The great ladies of that
race—it would be somewhere in Gibbon—weren't,
apparently, questioned about their mysteries. But
oh, poor Milly and hers! Susan at all events proved
scarce more inquisitive than if she had been a mosaic
at Ravenna. Susan was a porcelain monument to
the odd moral that consideration might, like cynicism,
have abysses. Besides, the Puritan finally
disencumbered——! What starved generations
wasn't Mrs. Stringham, in fancy, going to make up
for?

Milly was aware of how Susie sometimes adopted impenetrable, inscrutable levels of deference – behaviors that, without meaning to, created distance from familiarity and ease. It was as if Susie was recalling herself to good manners, the rules of formal etiquette – which, more than anything else, helped Milly understand.

Kate Croy came straight to the hotel—came that
evening shortly before dinner; specifically and publicly
moreover, in a hansom that, driven apparently
very fast, pulled up beneath their windows almost
with the clatter of an accident, a "smash." Milly,
alone, as happened, in the great garnished void of
their sitting-room, where, a little, really, like a caged
Byzantine, she had been pacing through the queer,
long-drawn, almost sinister delay of night, an effect
she yet liked—Milly, at the sound, one of the French
windows standing open, passed out to the balcony
that overhung, with pretensions, the general entrance,
and so was in time for the look that Kate,
alighting, paying her cabman, happened to send up
to the front. The visitor moreover had a shilling
back to wait for, during which Milly, from the balcony,
looked down at her, and a mute exchange, but
with smiles and nods, took place between them on
what had occurred in the morning. It was what
Kate had called for, and the tone was thus, almost
by accident, determined for Milly before her friend
came up. What was also, however, determined for
her was, again, yet irrepressibly again, that the
image presented to her, the splendid young woman
who looked so particularly handsome in impatience,
with the fine freedom of her signal, was the peculiar
property of somebody else's vision, that this fine
freedom in short was the fine freedom she showed
Mr. Densher. Just so was how she looked to
him, and just so was how Milly was held by
her—held as by the strange sense of seeing through
that distant person's eyes. It lasted, as usual, the
strange sense, but fifty seconds; yet in so lasting
it produced an effect. It produced in fact more
than one, and we take them in their order. The
first was that it struck our young woman as absurd
to say that a girl's looking so to a man could
possibly be without connections; and the second was
that by the time Kate had got into the room Milly
was in mental possession of the main connection it
must have for herself.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Kate Croy went straight to the hotel that evening, shortly before dinner. She arrived publicly in a hansom cab, driven very fast, which pulled up under their windows with a near-crash, like it was about to have an accident. Milly was alone in their huge, decorated sitting room. She had been pacing, like a caged bird, through the strange, long, almost ominous delay of the evening, which she secretly enjoyed. At the sound of the cab, one of the French windows was open, and Milly went out onto the balcony overlooking the entrance. She saw Kate getting out of the cab and paying the driver, and caught the look Kate sent up to the balcony. Kate had to wait for her change, during which time Milly looked down at her. They exchanged smiles and nods, without speaking, regarding what had happened that morning. Kate's arrival was what Milly had been waiting for, and the tone of their meeting was set, almost by accident, before Kate even came inside. However, Milly also realized, again, and uncontrollably, that the image of Kate presented to her – the beautiful young woman, looking particularly handsome in her impatience, with a certain confident air – was something someone else saw as well. That same confident air was how she presented herself to Mr. Densher. This was how she looked to him, and Milly was caught up in the experience, feeling as if she was seeing the world through that distant person's eyes. This strange sensation lasted only about fifty seconds, but it still had an effect. It had more than one, in fact, and we'll take them in order. First, it struck Milly as absurd to think that a girl could look at a man that way without there being some kind of connection. Second, by the time Kate came into the room, Milly understood the most important connection it had for *her* own life.</i></p></div>

She produced this commodity on the spot—produced
it, that is, in straight response to Kate's frank
"Well, what?" The inquiry bore of course, with
Kate's eagerness, on the issue of the morning's
scene, the great man's latest wisdom, and it doubtless
affected Milly a little as the cheerful demand for
news is apt to affect troubled spirits when news is
not, in one of the neater forms, prepared for delivery.
She couldn't have said what it was exactly that, on
the instant, determined her; the nearest description
of it would perhaps have been as the more vivid impression
of all her friend took for granted. The
contrast between this free quantity and the maze of
possibilities through which, for hours, she had herself
been picking her way, put on, in short, for the
moment, a grossness that even friendly forms scarce
lightened: it helped forward in fact the revelation
to herself that she absolutely had nothing to tell.
Besides which, certainly, there was something else—an
influence, at the particular juncture, still more
obscure. Kate had lost, on the way upstairs, the
look—<i>the</i> look—that made her young hostess so subtly
think and one of the signs of which was that she
never kept it for many moments at once; yet she
stood there, none the less, so in her bloom and in her
strength, so completely again the "handsome girl"
beyond all others, the "handsome girl" for whom
Milly had at first gratefully taken her, that to meet
her now with the note of the plaintive would amount
somehow to a surrender, to a confession. <i>She</i>
would never in her life be ill; the greatest doctor
would keep her, at the worst, the fewest minutes;
and it was as if she had asked just <i>with</i> all this practical
impeccability for all that was most mortal in
her friend. These things, for Milly, inwardly
danced their dance; but the vibration produced and
the dust kicked up had lasted less than our account
of them. Almost before she knew it she was answering,
and answering, beautifully, with no consciousness
of fraud, only as with a sudden flare of the
famous "will-power" she had heard about, read
about, and which was what her medical adviser had
mainly thrown her back on. "Oh, it's all right.
He's lovely."

The question, naturally, given Kate's eagerness, concerned the morning's event, the great man's latest pronouncements, and it probably affected Milly a little like the cheerful demand for news often affects someone feeling troubled when they don't have any convenient news to share. She couldn't say exactly what made her decide instantly. The closest way to describe it might be that she was more aware of what her friend simply assumed. The difference between this easy openness and the complex possibilities she'd been considering for hours created a sense of bluntness at that moment, which even friendly interactions couldn't entirely soften.

To respond with complaints now would be like giving up, like admitting something. Kate would never be sick; the best doctor would only have to deal with her for a short time.

<span class="box-label">Summary</span>
<p>Milly is waiting for a visit from her doctor, Sir Luke Strett, and has decided to allow him free access to her companion, Susan Shepherd.</p><p>The narrative focuses on an evening a few days before their departure from London. Milly, Susan, Mrs. Lowder, and Kate Croy are gathered at a hotel after dinner. It is decided that Mrs. Lowder and Susan will go on to a party, while Kate will stay behind with Milly.</p><p>After Susan leaves the room to get a shawl and Kate steps out onto a balcony, Mrs. Lowder asks Milly to mention a Mr. Densher to Kate, to find out if he has returned to London. Mrs. Lowder states that she worries he is bothering Kate, who she claims does not care for him. She explains that she cannot ask Kate herself because they never speak of him.</p><p>Milly questions this approach, noting that she has never mentioned knowing Mr. Densher to Kate before. They discuss the potential awkwardness of her raising the topic now. Milly asks if Mrs. Lowder likes Mr. Densher, and Mrs. Lowder says she does. Milly confirms that she met him in New York. The conversation continues with Milly raising further difficulties, such as what she should tell Kate about why she is asking. Finally, Milly asks if Mr. Densher has been writing to Kate, which Mrs. Lowder says is what she wants to know.</p><p>Just as Milly asks Mrs. Lowder if she believes Mr. Densher is with Kate, Susan returns to the room and Kate reappears in the window. Mrs. Lowder says "Hush!" and then leaves with Susan for the party.</p><p>Milly is left with Kate, who remains standing in the window. Milly looks at Kate and, without a word being spoken, understands that Mr. Densher has returned to London.</p>

<div class="analysis-box">
<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly**</li>
Milly is initially presented as a woman who has reached a state of grim resolution. Facing a limited number of "hours," she feels "enviably strong" and has a clear plan for an upcoming doctor's visit. She views the sympathy of others with a cynical, self-deprecating humor, labeling herself "gross, greedy, ravenous." Her situation shifts dramatically when Mrs. Lowder confronts her. This external pressure forces her out of her detached state, revealing a deep, hidden vulnerability concerning Mr. Densher. Her composure becomes a performance, requiring her to "smile hard" and carefully choose her words, one of which costs her more than any she has ever spoken. By the end of the scene, her perception has sharpened to the point where she can understand a complex truth simply by observing Kate's posture.
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)**</li>
Mrs. Lowder is presented as a powerful and calculating social strategist. She operates with "rich glibness" and has "fine onyx eyes" that do not blink, signifying her unreadable and determined nature. She initiates the scene's central conflict by attempting to use Milly as a tool to extract information about her niece. She frames her manipulative inquiry as a matter of concern for Kate and Mr. Densher, but her primary motivation is to enforce her own "views." When her initial approach is questioned, she shifts tactics from impatience to a disingenuous show of pity and concern, revealing her skill as a manipulator.
<li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Kate is presented almost entirely from the outside, as an object of discussion and observation. Initially, she is a silent, enigmatic figure hovering on a balcony. Mrs. Lowder characterizes her as a "proud young woman" who may be secretly defying her. Kate's situation shifts in the final moments as she moves from being the subject of the conversation to its unspoken resolution. Her mere presence, "handsome and upright" with "conscious eyes," is immediately interpreted by Milly as confirmation that Mr. Densher has returned. She communicates this pivotal fact without uttering a single word.
<li>*Susan Shepherd (Mrs. Stringham)**</li></ul>
Susan is presented as a benevolent but secondary figure, a companion used by others as a social substitute. Milly is pleased to "put people off with her," and Mrs. Lowder dismisses her as "better than nothing." Her situation is static; she serves primarily as a pawn whose departure and return frame the central, private conversation between Milly and Mrs. Lowder.

<p>
Milly indeed at last couldn't say; so that she had
really for the time brought it along to the point so
oddly marked for her by her visitor's arrival, the
truth that she was enviably strong. She carried this
out, from that evening, for each hour still left her,
and the more easily perhaps that the hours were now
narrowly numbered. All she actually waited for
was Sir Luke Strett's promised visit; as to her proceeding
on which, however, her mind was quite made
up. Since he wanted to get at Susie he should have
the freest access, and then perhaps he would see how
he liked it. What was between <i>them</i> they might
settle as between them, and any pressure it should lift
from her own spirit they were at liberty to convert
to their use. If the dear man wished to fire Susan
Shepherd with a still higher ideal, he would only
after all, at the worst, have Susan on his hands. If
devotion, in a word, was what it would come up for
the interested pair to organise, she was herself ready
to consume it as the dressed and served dish. He
had talked to her of her "appetite" her account of
which, she felt, must have been vague. But for devotion,
she could now see, this appetite would be of
the best. Gross, greedy, ravenous—these were
doubtless the proper names for her: she was at all
events resigned in advance to the machinations of
sympathy. The day that followed her lonely excursion
was to be the last but two or three of their stay
in London; and the evening of that day practically
ranked for them as, in the matter of outside relations,
the last of all. People were by this time quite scattered,
and many of those who had so liberally manifested
in calls, in cards, in evident sincerity about
visits, later on, over the land, had positively passed
in music out of sight; whether as members, these
latter, more especially, of Mrs. Lowder's immediate
circle or as members of Lord Mark's—our friends
being by this time able to make the distinction. The
general pitch had thus, decidedly, dropped, and the
occasions still to be dealt with were special and few.
One of these, for Milly, announced itself as the doctor's
call already mentioned, as to which she had now
had a note from him: the single other, of importance,
was their appointed leave-taking—for the
shortest separation—in respect to Mrs. Lowder and
Kate. The aunt and the niece were to dine with
them alone, intimately and easily—as easily as
should be consistent with the question of their afterwards
going on together to some absurdly belated
party, at which they had had it from Aunt Maud that
they would do well to show. Sir Luke was to make
his appearance on the morrow of this, and in respect
to that complication Milly had already her plan.
</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly truly couldn't say anything more. She had, in a way, brought things to a head at the very moment her visitor arrived, highlighting the truth that she was remarkably resilient. From that evening onward, she maintained this composure with each passing hour, perhaps made easier because her time was now limited. She was simply waiting for Sir Luke Strett's promised visit, and she'd already made up her mind about how to handle it. Since he wanted to pursue Susie, he would have complete access, and then maybe he'd see how he liked it. Whatever was between them, they could sort out amongst themselves, and any burden it lifted from her, they were welcome to use. If he wanted to fill Susan Shepherd with an even more passionate ideal, he would only, at worst, have Susan to deal with. If they were going to organize devotion, she was prepared to embrace it fully, like a prepared and served meal. He had mentioned her "appetite," which she felt she had described vaguely. But for devotion, she now realized, this appetite would be at its best. Intense, greedy, insatiable – those were probably the right words for her; she was prepared for the manipulations of empathy. The day after her solitary outing would be one of their last two or three days in London; and the evening of that day was essentially the end of their social life. People had mostly dispersed by now, and many of those who had been so generous with their calls, cards, and apparent eagerness for future visits had completely vanished, especially those in Mrs. Lowder's circle, and also those in Lord Mark's – our friends could now tell the difference. Social activity had declined, and the remaining events were special and few. One of these, for Milly, was the doctor's visit, about which she'd received a note; the other important event was their farewell visit to Mrs. Lowder and Kate. The aunt and niece were to have a private dinner with them, as relaxed as possible, given the question of whether they would all attend a ridiculously late party, which Aunt Maud had advised them to attend. Sir Luke was due the next day, and Milly already had a plan for that situation.</i></p></div>

<p>
The night was, at all events, hot and stale, and it
was late enough by the time the four ladies had been
gathered in, for their small session, at the hotel,
where the windows were still open to the high balconies
and the flames of the candles, behind the pink
shades—disposed as for the vigil of watchers—were
motionless in the air in which the season lay dead.
What was presently settled among them was that
Milly, who betrayed on this occasion a preference
more marked than usual, should not hold herself
obliged to climb that evening the social stair, however
it might stretch to meet her, and that, Mrs.
Lowder and Mrs. Stringham facing the ordeal together,
Kate Croy should remain with her and await
their return. It was a pleasure to Milly, ever, to
send Susan Shepherd forth; she saw her go with
complacency, liked, as it were, to put people off with
her, and noted with satisfaction, when she so moved
to the carriage, the further denudation—a markedly
ebbing tide—of her little benevolent back. If it
wasn't quite Aunt Maud's ideal, moreover, to take
out the new American girl's funny friend instead of
the new American girl herself, nothing could better
indicate the range of that lady's merit than the spirit
in which—as at the present hour for instance—she
made the best of the minor advantage. And she did
this with a broad, cheerful absence of illusion; she
did it—confessing even as much to poor Susie—because,
frankly, she <i>was</i> good-natured. When Mrs.
Stringham observed that her own light was too abjectly
borrowed and that it was as a link alone,
fortunately not missing, that she was valued, Aunt
Maud concurred to the extent of the remark: "Well,
my dear, you're better than nothing." To-night,
furthermore, it came up for Milly that Aunt Maud
had something particular in mind. Mrs. Stringham,
before adjourning with her, had gone off for
some shawl or other accessory, and Kate, as if a little
impatient for their withdrawal, had wandered out
to the balcony, where she hovered, for the time, unseen,
though with scarce more to look at than the
dim London stars and the cruder glow, up the street,
on a corner, of a small public-house, in front of
which a fagged cab-horse was thrown into relief.
Mrs. Lowder made use of the moment: Milly felt
as soon as she had spoken that what she was doing
was somehow for use.

The windows were still open to the balconies, and the candlelight behind the pink lampshades – arranged as if for a vigil – didn't flicker in the still air.</i></p><p><i>What they decided was that Milly, who showed a stronger preference than usual, wouldn't have to go out that evening. She wouldn't be obligated to navigate the social scene, no matter how much effort it took. Instead, Mrs. Lowder and Mrs. Stringham would go together, and Kate Croy would stay behind with Milly and wait for them to return. Milly always enjoyed sending Susan Shepherd out on these social missions. She watched her go with contentment, as if she liked using Susan to deflect attention, and noticed with satisfaction how Susan’s back receded from view as she got into the carriage.</i></p><p><i>Furthermore, it wasn’t exactly Aunt Maud’s first choice to take the new American girl's “funny friend” (Mrs. Stringham) out instead of the American girl herself. However, nothing demonstrated Aunt Maud’s admirable qualities more than her ability to make the best of a secondary role. She did this without any illusions; she did it – she even admitted as much to poor Susan – because she was, frankly, good-natured. When Mrs. Stringham remarked that her own importance was borrowed and that she was only valued as a useful connection, Aunt Maud agreed: "Well, darling, you're better than nothing."</i></p><p><i>Tonight, it also occurred to Milly that Aunt Maud had something specific in mind. Mrs. Stringham had stepped away to retrieve a shawl or other accessory before leaving with Aunt Maud, and Kate, seeming a little eager for them to leave, had gone out to the balcony. She stayed there, unseen for the moment, with little to look at except the faint London stars and the harsh glow from a pub on a nearby corner, which illuminated a tired cab horse.</i></p><p><i>Mrs. Lowder took advantage of the opportunity to speak.

"Dear Susan tells me that you saw, in America,
Mr. Densher—whom I've never till now, as you may
have noticed, asked you about. But do you mind at
last, in connection with him, doing something for
me?" She had lowered her fine voice to a depth,
though speaking with all her rich glibness; and
Milly, after a small sharpness of surprise, was already
guessing the sense of her appeal. "Will you
name him, in any way you like, to <i>her"</i>—and Aunt
Maud gave a nod at the window; "so that you may
perhaps find out whether he's back?"

Ever so many things, for Milly, fell into line at
this; it was a wonder, she afterwards thought, that
she could be conscious of so many at once. She
smiled hard, however, for them all. "But I don't
know that it's important to me to 'find out.'" The
array of things was further swollen, however, even
as she said this, by its striking her as too much to
say. She therefore tried as quickly to say less.
"Except you mean, of course, that it's important to
<i>you."</i> She fancied Aunt Maud was looking at her
almost as hard as she was herself smiling, and that
gave her another impulse. "You know I never
<i>have</i> yet named him to her; so that if I should break
out now——"

She felt like Aunt Maud was staring at her as intently as she was smiling, and that prompted another thought.

"Well," said Aunt Maud, whose fine onyx eyes
failed to blink, even though Milly's questions might
have been taken as drawing her rather further than
she had originally meant to go—"well, Kate is thoroughly
aware of my views for her, and that I take
her being with me, at present, in the way she is with
me, if you know what I mean, as a loyal assent to
them. Therefore as my views don't happen to provide
a place, at all, for Mr. Densher, much, in a manner,
as I like him"—therefore, therefore in short
she had been prompted to this step, though she completed
her sense, but sketchily, with the rattle of her
large fan.

Milly hesitated, for the question was somehow as
the sudden point of something sharp on a nerve that
winced. She just caught her breath, but she had
ground for joy afterwards, she felt, in not really
having failed to choose with quickness sufficient, out
of fifteen possible answers, the one that would best
serve her. She was then almost proud, as well, that
she had cheerfully smiled. "I did—three times—in
New York." So came and went for her, in these
simple words, the speech that was to figure for her,
later on, that night, as the one she had ever uttered
that cost her most. She was to lie awake, at all
events, half the night, for the gladness of not having
taken any line so really inferior as the denial of a
happy impression.

But ah, the inquiry had only to be made to bring
the rare colour with fine inconsequence, to her face.
"Not, really, the least little bit!" And, quickly
feeling the need to abound in this sense, she was on
the point, to cut short, of declaring that she cared,
after all, no scrap how much she obliged. Only she
felt at this instant too the intervention of still other
things. Mrs. Lowder was, in the first place, already
beforehand, already affected as by the sudden vision
of her having herself pushed too far. Milly could
never judge from her face of her uppermost motive—it
was so little, in its hard, smooth sheen, that kind
of human countenance. She looked hard when she
spoke fair; the only thing was that when she spoke
hard she likewise didn't look soft. Something, none
the less, had arisen in her now—a full appreciable
tide, entering by the rupture of some bar. She announced
that if what she had asked was to prove in
the least a bore her young friend was not to dream
of it; making her young friend at the same time, by
the change in her tone, dream on the spot more profusely.
She spoke with a belated light, Milly could
apprehend—she could always apprehend—from
pity; and the result of that perception, for the girl,
was singular: it proved to her as quickly that Kate,
keeping her secret, had been straight with her.
From Kate distinctly then, as to why she was to be
pitied, Aunt Maud knew nothing, and was thereby
simply putting in evidence the fine side of her own
character. This fine side was that she could almost
at any hour, by a kindled preference or a diverted
energy, glow for another interest than her own.
She exclaimed as well, at this moment, that Milly
must have been thinking, round the case, much more
than she had supposed; and this remark could, at
once, affect the girl as sharply as any other form of
the charge of weakness. It was what everyone, if
she didn't look out, would soon be saying—"There's
something the matter with you!" What one was
therefore one's self concerned immediately to establish
was that there was nothing at all. "I shall like
to help you; I shall like, so far as that goes, to help
Kate herself," she made such haste as she could to
declare; her eyes wandering meanwhile across the
width of the room to that dusk of the balcony in
which their companion perhaps a little unaccountably
lingered. She suggested hereby her impatience
to begin; she almost overtly wondered at the length
of the opportunity this friend was giving them—referring
it, however, so far as words went, to the
other friend, breaking off with an amused: "How
tremendously Susie must be beautifying!"
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>But just asking the question immediately brought a rosy flush to her face, a seemingly insignificant reaction. "Not at all!" And quickly feeling the need to emphasize this, she was about to declare that she didn't care at all how much she was inconveniencing them. But at that moment, she also felt other things influencing her. First of all, Mrs. Lowder seemed to have already anticipated her, reacting as though she had suddenly realized she'd gone too far. Milly could never tell from her expression what Mrs. Lowder was really thinking—her hard, smooth face revealed so little of her true emotions. She looked severe even when she was being pleasant; the only thing was that she didn't soften her expression when she spoke harshly either. Still, something was happening in her now—a significant emotional shift, like a dam breaking. She said that if what she had asked was even slightly bothersome, Milly shouldn't even consider it; and, by the change in her tone, made her young friend suddenly consider it even more.</i></p><p><i>Milly could sense a delayed understanding in Kate's words—she always could—and it came from pity. This perception had a strange effect on Milly: it quickly proved to her that Kate, despite keeping a secret, had been honest with her. From Kate, then, Aunt Maud knew nothing about why Milly should be pitied, and was merely demonstrating the good side of her own nature. This good side was that she could almost always, through a strong preference or a redirected focus, show genuine interest in something other than herself.</i></p><p><i>She also exclaimed at that moment that Milly must have been thinking about the situation more than she had realized; and this remark could instantly sting Milly, like any accusation of weakness. It was what everyone, if she wasn't careful, would soon be saying—"There's something wrong with you!" So what she immediately needed to establish was that there was nothing wrong at all. "I'd like to help you; I'd like to help Kate herself," she quickly declared; her eyes drifting across the room to the shadowy balcony where their companion was perhaps a little inexplicably lingering. She was subtly indicating her eagerness to get started; she almost openly wondered why their friend was taking so long—referring to it, though, through words, to the other friend, and concluding with an amused, "How wonderfully Susie must be making herself beautiful!"</i></p></div>

Aunt Maud took it in—took in, that is, everything
of the tone that she just wanted her not to; and the
result for some seconds, was but to make their eyes
meet in silence. Mrs. Stringham had rejoined them
and was asking if Kate had gone—an inquiry at once
answered by this young lady's reappearance. They
saw her again in the open window, where, looking
at them, she had paused—producing thus, on Aunt
Maud's part, almost too impressive a "Hush!"
Mrs. Lowder indeed, without loss of time, smothered
any danger in a sweeping retreat with Susie;
but Milly's words to her, just uttered, about dealing
with her niece directly, struck our young woman as
already recoiling on herself. Directness, however
evaded, would be, fully, for <i>her;</i> nothing in fact
would ever have been for her so direct as the evasion.
Kate had remained in the window, very handsome
and upright, the outer dark framing in a highly
favourable way her summery simplicities and lightnesses
of dress. Milly had, given the relation of
space, no real fear she had heard their talk; only she
hovered there as with conscious eyes and some added
advantage. Then indeed, with small delay, her
friend sufficiently saw. The conscious eyes, the
added advantage were but those she had now always
at command—those proper to the person Milly knew
as known to Merton Densher. It was for several
seconds again as if the <i>total</i> of her identity had been
that of the person known to him—a determination
having for result another sharpness of its own.
Kate had positively but to be there just as she was to
tell her he had come back. It seemed to pass between
them, in fine, without a word, that he was in
London, that he was perhaps only round the corner;
and surely therefore no dealing of Milly's with her
would yet have been so direct.

<p>Milly and Kate sit together. While they talk, Kate repeatedly gets up and walks the length of the room. Kate speaks about English society, Aunt Maud, and Lord Mark.</p><p>In their conversation, Kate says Aunt Maud is using her as a bargaining chip. Milly insists she is not an obstacle for Kate regarding Lord Mark. Kate advises Milly to leave their social circle. Milly asks why she says such things. Kate replies, "Because you're a dove," then embraces and kisses her.</p><p>They hear their companions returning. Mrs. Lowder and Mrs. Stringham enter the room. Kate talks with Mrs. Stringham. Mrs. Lowder asks Milly how the evening went, and Milly replies, "I don't think, dear lady, he's here." Mrs. Lowder calls her an "exquisite thing." The visitors then leave.</p><p>The next morning, Milly tells Mrs. Stringham that a doctor, Sir Luke Strett, has an appointment to see her at eleven, but that she will be going out. Milly instructs Mrs. Stringham to tell Sir Luke that Milly is home, and then to meet with him in her place. Milly then says she is going to the National Gallery.</p>

<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale** is presented as a passive but highly perceptive observer. She feels herself to be in a "current determined... by others," surrendering to being "dealt with." While physically still, her mind is active, analyzing the performances of those around her. An immediate shift occurs when Kate calls her a "dove." Milly instantly seizes this as a "revealed truth," an identity that gives her a new framework for how to act. This new self-perception prompts a change in her situation: she moves from passively receiving plans to actively, if deceptively, creating one by arranging for Mrs. Stringham to meet Sir Luke Strett in her place.</li>
<li>*Kate Croy** is presented as an active and theatrical performer. She is restless, "charming," and in "extraordinary 'form,'" moving and talking to dominate the scene. She projects a hard, cynical frankness, openly deconstructing her aunt, English society, and her own "commercial" position. Her situation shifts abruptly in response to Milly's simple, emotional question. She pivots from a pacing, almost predatory ("panther") cynicism to a ceremonial tenderness, bestowing the "dove" identity upon Milly with a kiss, thus changing the dynamic between them from a lecture to an anointing.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud)** is presented as a powerful social strategist whose influence is felt even when she is absent. Kate describes her as a manipulator who uses her niece as a commodity. When she appears, her purpose is to regain control of the situation ("catch hold... of the loose end"). Her immediate situation shifts when Milly directly counters her unspoken plan; Mrs. Lowder's response is a look of "deep criticism" followed by effusive, tactical praise ("Oh, you exquisite thing!"), showing her ability to adapt instantly to a setback.</li>
<li>*Mrs. Stringham (Susie)** is presented as an imaginative and loyal companion. Her role is supportive, and she is easily enrolled in Milly’s plans. Upon hearing Milly’s new arrangement for the doctor, her initial shock is quickly "engulfed" by an "extravagance of assent," immediately accepting her assigned part in the "Byzantine" scheme.</li></ul>

It was doubtless because this queer form of directness
had in itself, for the hour, seemed so sufficient
that Milly was afterwards aware of having really,
all the while—during the strange, indescribable session
before the return of their companions—done
nothing to intensify it. If she was most aware only
afterwards, under the long, discurtained ordeal of
the morrow's dawn, that was because she had really,
till their evening's end came, ceased, after a little,
to miss anything from their ostensible comfort.
What was behind showed but in gleams and
glimpses; what was in front never at all confessed
to not holding the stage. Three minutes had not
passed before Milly quite knew she should have done
nothing Aunt Maud had just asked her. She knew
it moreover by much the same light that had acted
for her with that lady and with Sir Luke Strett. It
pressed upon her then and there that she was still in
a current determined, through her indifference, timidity,
bravery, generosity—she scarce could say
which—by others; that not she but the current
acted, and that somebody else, always, was the
keeper of the lock or the dam. Kate for example
had but to open the flood-gate: the current moved
in its mass—the current, as it had been, of her doing
as Kate wanted. What, somehow, in the most
extraordinary way in the world, <i>had</i> Kate wanted
but to be, of a sudden, more interesting than she had
ever been? Milly, for their evening then, quite held
her breath with the appreciation of it. If she hadn't
been sure her companion would have had nothing,
from her moments with Mrs. Lowder, to go by, she
would almost have seen the admirable creature "cutting in"
to anticipate a danger. This fantasy indeed,
while they sat together, dropped after a little;
even if only because other fantasies multiplied and
clustered, making fairly, for our young woman, the
buoyant medium in which her friend talked and
moved. They sat together, I say, but Kate moved
as much as she talked; she figured there, restless and
charming, just perhaps a shade perfunctory, repeatedly
quitting her place, taking slowly, to and fro, in
the trailing folds of her light dress, the length of the
room, and almost avowedly performing for the
pleasure of her hostess.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>It was probably because this unusual, direct way of speaking seemed perfectly adequate at the time. Milly realized later, after the strange, indescribable meeting before the others returned, that she hadn't done anything to enhance it. She only became truly aware of this the next morning, as the long, drawn-out day began, because she had stopped missing anything from their outward comfort by the end of the evening. What lay beneath the surface was only hinted at; what was on the surface never admitted to not being the main focus. Three minutes hadn't gone by before Milly knew she should have done something else, something Aunt Maud had just asked of her. She knew this for the same reason she'd known it with Aunt Maud and with Sir Luke Strett. It struck her then that she was still caught in a force determined by others—through her indifference, her shyness, her courage, her generosity, she couldn't say which. It wasn't she who was acting, but the force itself, and someone else was always in control. Kate, for example, only had to open the floodgates, and the force—the force of her own doing, because Kate wanted it—would move. What, in the most extraordinary way, had Kate wanted, other than to suddenly become more interesting than she'd ever been? Milly, for that evening, was absolutely captivated by this idea. If she hadn't been sure her companion had nothing to go on from her time with Mrs. Lowder, she would have almost thought the admirable creature was "stepping in" to prevent a danger. This fantasy faded after a bit while they sat together, perhaps because other fantasies took over, creating a buoyant atmosphere for our young woman as her friend talked and moved. They sat together, I repeat, but Kate moved as much as she talked; she was there, restless and charming, perhaps a little superficial, constantly leaving her seat, pacing the length of the room slowly back and forth in the folds of her light dress, almost as if she were performing for her hostess's amusement.</i></p></div>

<p>
Mrs. Lowder had said to Milly at Matcham that
she and her niece, as allies, could practically conquer
the world; but though it was a speech about which
there had even then been a vague, grand glamour,
the girl read into it at present more of an approach
to a meaning. Kate, for that matter, by herself,
could conquer anything, and <i>she,</i> Milly Theale, was
probably concerned with the "world" only as the
small scrap of it that most impinged on her and that
was therefore first to be dealt with. On this basis
of being dealt with she would doubtless herself do
her share of the conquering: she would have something
to supply, Kate something to take—each of
them thus, to that tune, something for squaring with
Aunt Maud's ideal. This in short was what it came
to now—that the occasion, in the quiet late lamplight,
had the quality of a rough rehearsal of the possible
big drama. Milly knew herself dealt with—handsomely,
completely: she surrendered to the
knowledge, for so it was, she felt, that she supplied
her helpful force. And what Kate had to take Kate
took as freely and, to all appearance, as gratefully;
accepting afresh, with each of her long, slow walks,
the relation between them so established and consecrating
her companion's surrender simply by the interest
she gave it. The interest to Milly herself we
naturally mean; the interest to Kate Milly felt as
probably inferior. It easily and largely came for
their present talk, for the quick flight of the hour
before the breach of the spell—it all came, when considered,
from the circumstance, not in the least abnormal,
that the handsome girl was in extraordinary
"form." Milly remembered her having said that
she was at her best late at night; remembered it by
its having, with its fine assurance, made her wonder
when <i>she</i> was at her best and how happy people must
be who had such a fixed time. She had no time at
all; she was never at her best—unless indeed it were
exactly, as now, in listening, watching, admiring,
collapsing. If Kate moreover, quite mercilessly,
had never been so good, the beauty and the marvel
of it was that she had never really been so frank;
being a person of such a calibre, as Milly would have
said, that, even while "dealing" with you and thereby,
as it were, picking her steps, she could let herself
go, could, in irony, in confidence, in extravagance,
tell you things she had never told before. That was
the impression—that she was telling things, and
quite conceivably for her own relief as well; almost
as if the errors of vision, the mistakes of proportion,
the residuary innocence of spirit still to be remedied
on the part of her auditor had their moments of proving
too much for her nerves. She went at them just
now, these sources of irritation, with an amused
energy that it would have been open to Milly to regard
as cynical and that was nevertheless called for—as
to this the other was distinct—by the way that
in certain connections the American mind broke
down. It seemed at least—the American mind as
sitting there thrilled and dazzled in Milly—not to
understand English society without a separate confrontation
with <i>all</i> the cases. It couldn't proceed
by—there was some technical term she lacked until
Milly suggested both analogy and induction, and
then, differently, instinct, none of which were right:
it had to be led up and introduced to each aspect of
the monster, enabled to walk all round it, whether for
the consequent exaggerated ecstasy or for the still
more as appeared to this critic disproportionate
shock. It might, the monster, Kate conceded, loom
large for those born amid forms less developed and
therefore no doubt less amusing; it might on some
sides be a strange and dreadful monster, calculated
to devour the unwary, to abase the proud, to scandalize
the good; but if one had to live with it one must,
not to be for ever sitting up, learn how: which was
virtually in short to-night what the handsome girl
showed herself as teaching.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Mrs. Lowder had told Milly at Matcham that she and her niece, working together, could practically rule the world. While that statement had a vague, romantic appeal back then, Milly now understood it more clearly. Kate, on her own, could probably achieve anything. Milly, on the other hand, was probably only concerned with the part of the world that directly affected her, the part she needed to deal with first. Based on this understanding, she figured she'd contribute her share to their "conquest." She would provide something, and Kate would take something – both of them fulfilling Aunt Maud's expectations.</i></p><p><i>Essentially, in the quiet lamplight, it felt like a practice run for a major event. Milly felt she was being "dealt with" graciously and completely. She accepted it because she knew she was contributing her positive energy. And Kate took what Milly offered just as freely and gratefully, renewing the bond between them with each of their long, slow walks, validating her companion's contribution simply by showing interest in it. Of course, Milly assumed the interest was mainly for herself; Kate's interest was probably secondary.</i></p><p><i>All this talk, this quick hour before they stopped, stemmed from the fact that the beautiful Kate was in top form. Milly remembered Kate saying she was best late at night, and how that statement had made her wonder when *she* was at her best, and how lucky people were to have a consistent time like that. She had no consistent time; she was never at her best – unless, of course, she was listening, watching, admiring, and yielding, like now.</i></p><p><i>Moreover, if Kate had never been so impressive, the amazing thing was that she had never been so open. Kate, being the type of person she was, could open up, even while guiding and advising Milly. She could be ironic, confidential, and expressive, and tell things she never told before. That was the feeling: that she was finally revealing things, maybe for her own benefit as well. It was as if Milly's errors in perception and understanding, and her remaining naivety, were occasionally too much for Kate to handle.</i></p><p><i>Kate addressed those irritations with an amused energy that Milly might have found cynical, but that was necessary, as the other woman saw it, because of the way the American mind processed things in certain social situations. It seemed to Kate – who was observing an enthralled and amazed Milly – that the American mind couldn't grasp English society without analyzing every single case. It couldn't use a certain method – Milly didn’t know the exact term, until she suggested analogy and induction, and then instinct, none of which were quite right. Instead, the American mind had to be guided and introduced to each aspect of the "monster" (English society), allowed to explore it thoroughly, whether for extreme delight or, as Kate saw it, for excessive shock.</i></p><p><i>This "monster," Kate admitted, might seem huge to those who were used to less complex forms of society, and therefore, undoubtedly, less entertaining. It might be a strange and terrifying monster, designed to hurt the naive, humble the proud, and offend the virtuous. But if you had to deal with it, you had to learn how, instead of being constantly on edge. And that’s what Kate was, in essence, showing Milly tonight.</i></p></div>

She gave away publicly, in this process, Lancaster
Gate and everything it contained; she gave away,
hand over hand, Milly's thrill continued to note,
Aunt Maud and Aunt Maud's glories and Aunt
Maud's complacencies; she gave herself away most
of all, and it was naturally what most contributed to
her candour. She didn't speak to her friend once
more, in Aunt Maud's strain, of how they could scale
the skies; she spoke, by her bright, perverse preference
on this occasion, of the need, in the first place,
of being neither stupid nor vulgar. It might have
been a lesson, for our young American, in the art of
seeing things as they were—a lesson so various and
so sustained that the pupil had, as we have shown,
but receptively to gape. The odd thing furthermore
was that it could serve its purpose while explicitly
disavowing every personal bias. It wasn't that she
disliked Aunt Maud, who was everything she had on
other occasions declared; but the dear woman, ineffaceably
stamped by inscrutable nature and a dreadful
art, wasn't—how <i>could</i> she be?—what she
wasn't. She wasn't any one. She wasn't anything.
She wasn't anywhere. Milly mustn't think it—one
couldn't, as a good friend, let her. Those hours at
Matcham were <i>inespérées,</i> were pure manna from
heaven; or if not wholly that perhaps, with humbugging
old Lord Mark as a backer, were vain as a
ground for hopes and calculations. Lord Mark was
very well, but he wasn't <i>the</i> cleverest creature in
England, and even if he had been he still wouldn't
have been the most obliging. He weighed it out in
ounces, and indeed each of the pair was really waiting
for what the other would put down.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>In this situation, she openly revealed everything about herself, including her home in Lancaster Gate and everything inside it. Milly was fascinated to see how completely she gave herself away, bit by bit. She also revealed details about Aunt Maud, including her accomplishments and self-satisfaction. Ultimately, she revealed herself the most, which, naturally, made her more honest. She stopped talking to her friend in Aunt Maud’s style, about how they could achieve the impossible. Instead, she chose to focus, in a clear and contrary way, on the importance of not being unintelligent or crass. For our young American friend, it could have been a lesson in seeing things as they truly were, a lesson so comprehensive and consistent that the pupil, as we've seen, could only absorb it passively. The strange part was that the lesson worked even though she denied having any personal preferences. It wasn't that she disliked Aunt Maud, who embodied everything she had previously described, but the dear woman, shaped indelibly by nature and a terrible kind of art, wasn't—how could she be?—what she wasn't. She didn't have a true identity. She was nothing. She was nowhere. Milly shouldn't believe it—and as a good friend, she couldn't allow it. Those hours at Matcham were unexpected, like a gift from heaven. Or, maybe not quite that, with old Lord Mark, who was full of it, backing them up, it was a waste of time to build hopes and make plans. Lord Mark was fine, but he wasn’t the smartest person in England, and even if he was, he wouldn’t be the most helpful. He measured everything carefully, and in reality, they were both waiting to see what the other would contribute.</i></p></div>

"Lest"—Kate took it up—"he should suddenly
grab me and run? Oh, as he isn't ready to run, he's
much less ready, naturally, to grab. I <i>am</i>—you're
so far right as that—on the counter, when I'm not
in the shop-window; in and out of which I'm thus
conveniently, commercially whisked: the essence, all
of it, of my position, and the price, as properly, of
my aunt's protection." Lord Mark was substantially
what she had begun with as soon as they were
alone; the impression was even yet with Milly of
her having sounded his name, having imposed it, as
a topic, in direct opposition to the other name that
Mrs. Lowder had left in the air and that all her own
look, as we have seen, kept there at first for her companion.
The immediate strange effect had been that
of her consciously needing, as it were, an alibi—which,
successfully, she so found. She had worked
it to the end, ridden it to and fro across the course
marked for Milly by Aunt Maud, and now she had
quite, so to speak, broken it in. "The bore is that
if she wants him so much—wants him, heaven forgive
her! for <i>me</i>—he has put us all out, since your
arrival, by wanting somebody else. I don't mean
somebody else than you."

All of which made for the impression, fantastic
or not, of the <i>alibi.</i> The splendour, the grandeur
were, for Milly, the bold ironic spirit behind it, so
interesting too in itself. What, moreover, was not
less interesting was the fact, as our young woman
noted it, that Kate confined her point to the difficulties,
so far as <i>she</i> was concerned, raised only by Lord
Mark. She referred now to none that her own taste
might present; which circumstance again played its
little part. She was doing what she liked in respect
to another person, but she was in no way committed
to the other person, and her furthermore talking of
Lord Mark as not young and not true were only the
signs of her clear self-consciousness, were all in the
line of her slightly hard, but scarce the less graceful
extravagance. She didn't wish to show too much
her consent to be arranged for, but that was a different
thing from not wishing sufficiently to give it.
There was something moreover, on it all, that Milly
still found occasion to say, "If your aunt has been,
as you tell me, put out by me, I feel that she has
remained remarkably kind."

<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>All of this created the (whether real or imagined) impression of an alibi. The wealth and luxury were, for Milly, the surprisingly ironic spirit behind it all, and that was fascinating in itself. What was also interesting was that Kate only mentioned the problems that Lord Mark caused, as Milly observed. Kate didn't mention any personal preferences that might create obstacles. This also played a small role in the situation. Kate was doing what she wanted with another person involved, but she wasn't obligated to that other person. Her comments about Lord Mark – that he wasn't young and wasn't genuine – were simply signs of her awareness of herself. They were part of her slightly tough, but still graceful, way of acting. She didn't want to seem too eager to be manipulated, but that was different from not being willing enough to allow it.</i></p><p><i>Moreover, Milly still felt compelled to say, "If your aunt is annoyed with me, as you say, she's certainly been remarkably kind about it."</i></p></div>

"Oh, but she has—whatever might have happened
in that respect—plenty of use for you! You
put her in, my dear, more than you put her out. You
don't half see it, but she has clutched your petticoat.
You can do anything—you can do, I mean, lots that
<i>we</i> can't. You're an outsider, independent and
standing by yourself; you're not hideously relative
to tiers and tiers of others." And Kate, facing in
that direction, went further and further; wound up,
while Milly gaped, with extraordinary words.
"We're of no use to you—it's decent to tell you.
You'd be of use to us, but that's a different matter.
My honest advice to you would be—" she went
indeed all lengths—"to drop us while you can. It
would be funny if you didn't soon see how awfully
better you can do. We've not really done for you
the least thing worth speaking of—nothing you
mightn't easily have had in some other way. Therefore
you're under no obligation. You won't want
us next year; we shall only continue to want <i>you.</i>
But that's no reason for you, and you mustn't pay
too dreadfully for poor Mrs. Stringham's having let
you in. She has the best conscience in the world;
she's enchanted with what she has done; but you
shouldn't take your people from <i>her.</i> It has been
quite awful to see you do it."

We haven't really done anything for you that was really worth anything – nothing you couldn't have easily gotten somewhere else. So you don't owe us anything. You won't need us next year; we'll be the ones needing you. But that's not a reason for you to stay, and you shouldn't suffer too much because Mrs. Stringham got you involved. She has the best intentions; she's thrilled with what she's done; but you shouldn't depend on us. It's been terrible to watch you do it."</i></p></div>

Milly tried to be amused, so as not—it was too
absurd—to be fairly frightened. Strange enough
indeed—if not natural enough—that, late at night
thus, in a mere mercenary house, with Susie away,
a want of confidence should possess her. She recalled,
with all the rest of it, the next day, piecing
things together in the dawn, that she had felt herself
alone with a creature who paced like a panther.
That was a violent image, but it made her a little less
ashamed of having been scared. For all her scare,
none the less, she had now the sense to find words.
"And yet without Susie I shouldn't have had you."

Really at last, thus, it had been too much; as, with
her own least feeble flare, after a wondering watch,
Milly had shown. She hadn't cared; she had too
much wanted to know; and, though a small solemnity
of reproach, a sombre strain, had broken into
her tone, it was to figure as her nearest approach to
serving Mrs. Lowder. "Why do you say such

<p>
This unexpectedly had acted, by a sudden turn of
Kate's attitude, as a happy speech. She had risen
as she spoke, and Kate had stopped before her, shining
at her instantly with a softer brightness. Poor
Milly hereby enjoyed one of her views of how people,
wincing oddly, were often touched by her.
"Because you're a dove." With which she felt herself
ever so delicately, so considerately, embraced;
not with familiarity or as a liberty taken, but almost
ceremonially and in the manner of an accolade; partly
as if, though a dove who could perch on a finger, one
were also a princess with whom forms were to be
observed. It even came to her, through the touch
of her companion's lips, that this form, this cool pressure,
fairly sealed the sense of what Kate had just
said. It was moreover, for the girl, like an inspiration:
she found herself accepting as the right one,
while she caught her breath with relief, the name so
given her. She met it on the instant as she would
have met the revealed truth; it lighted up the strange
dusk in which she lately had walked. <i>That</i> was
what was the matter with her. She was a dove.
Oh, <i>wasn't</i> she?—it echoed within her as she became
aware of the sound, outside, of the return of their
friends. There was, the next thing, little enough
doubt about it after Aunt Maud had been two minutes
in the room. She had come up, Mrs. Lowder,
with Susan—which she needn't have done, at that
hour, instead of letting Kate come down to her; so
that Milly could be quite sure it was to catch hold,
in some way, of the loose end they had left. Well,
the way she did catch was simply to make the point
that it didn't now in the least matter. She had
mounted the stairs for this, and she had her moment
again with her younger hostess while Kate, on the
spot, as the latter at the time noted, gave Susan
Shepherd unwonted opportunities. Kate was in
other words, as Aunt Maud engaged her friend, listening
with the handsomest response to Mrs. Stringham's
impression of the scene they had just quitted.
It was in the tone of the fondest indulgence—almost,
really, that of dove cooing to dove—that Mrs. Lowder
expressed to Milly the hope that it had all gone
beautifully. Her "all" had an ample benevolence;
it soothed and simplified; she spoke as if it were the
two young women, not she and her comrade, who
had been facing the town together. But Milly's
answer had prepared itself while Aunt Maud was on
the stair; she had felt in a rush all the reasons that
would make it the most dovelike; and she gave it,
while she was about it, as earnest, as candid. "I
don't <i>think,</i> dear lady, he's here."
</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>This surprisingly worked, a sudden change in Kate's behavior, like a blessing.

Well, what she ended up doing was simply pointing out that it didn't matter. She'd climbed the stairs for this, and she had her moment alone with the younger hostess while Kate, as she noticed, gave Susan Shepherd an unusual amount of attention.

It gave her straightway the measure of the success
she could have as a dove: that was recorded in the
long look of deep criticism, a look without a word,
that Mrs. Lowder poured forth. And the word,
presently, bettered it still. "Oh, you exquisite
thing!" The luscious innuendo of it, almost startling,
lingered in the room, after the visitors had
gone, like an oversweet fragrance. But left alone
with Mrs. Stringham Milly continued to breathe it:
she studied again the dovelike and so set her companion
to mere rich reporting that she averted all inquiry
into her own case.

<p>
That, with the new day, was once more her law—though
she saw before her, of course, as something
of a complication, her need, each time, to decide.
She should have to be clear as to how a dove <i>would</i>
act. She settled it, she thought, well enough this
morning by quite readopting her plan in respect to
Sir Luke Strett. That, she was pleased to reflect,
had originally been pitched in the key of a merely iridescent
drab; and although Mrs. Stringham, after
breakfast, began by staring at it as if it had been a
priceless Persian carpet suddenly unrolled at her
feet, she had no scruple, at the end of five minutes,
in leaving her to make the best of it. "Sir Luke
Strett comes, by appointment, to see me at eleven,
but I'm going out on purpose. He's to be told,
please, deceptively, that I'm at home, and, you, as
my representative, when he comes up, are to see him
instead. He will like that, this time, better. So do
be nice to him." It had taken, naturally, more explanation,
and the mention, above all, of the fact that
the visitor was the greatest of doctors; yet when
once the key had been offered Susie slipped it on her
bunch, and her young friend could again feel her
lovely imagination operate. It operated in truth
very much as Mrs. Lowder's, at the last, had done
the night before: it made the air heavy once more
with the extravagance of assent. It might, afresh,
almost have frightened our young woman to see how
people rushed to meet her: <i>had</i> she then so little
time to live that the road must always be spared her?
It was as if they were helping her to take it out on
the spot. Susie—she couldn't deny, and didn't pretend
to—might, of a truth, on <i>her</i> side, have treated
such news as a flash merely lurid; as to which, to
do Susie justice, the pain of it was all there. But,
none the less, the margin always allowed her young
friend was all there as well; and the proposal now
made her what was it in short but Byzantine?
The vision of Milly's perception of the propriety of
the matter had, at any rate, quickly engulfed, so far
as her attitude was concerned, any surprise and any
shock; so that she only desired, the next thing, perfectly
to possess the facts. Milly could easily speak,
on this, as if there were only one: she made nothing
of such another as that she had felt herself menaced.
The great fact, in fine, was that she <i>knew</i>
him to desire just now, more than anything else, to
meet, quite apart, some one interested in her. Who
therefore so interested as her faithful Susan? The
only other circumstance that, by the time she had
quitted her friend, she had treated as worth mentioning
was the circumstance of her having at first
intended to keep quiet. She had originally best seen
herself as sweetly secretive. As to that she had
changed, and her present request was the result.
She didn't say why she had changed, but she trusted
her faithful Susan. Their visitor would trust her
not less, and she herself would adore their visitor.
Moreover he wouldn't—the girl felt sure—tell her
anything dreadful. The worst would be that he
was in love and that he needed a confidant to work
it. And now she was going to the National Gallery.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>As the new day began, she was once again faced with her usual routine, though she found the need to make a decision each time a bit complicated. She needed to be as decisive as a dove. She decided, she thought, this morning was well-handled by simply re-committing to her plan regarding Sir Luke Strett. That plan, she was pleased to recall, had initially been presented in a subtle, understated way. And although Mrs. Stringham, after breakfast, reacted to the plan as if it were a priceless Persian carpet suddenly unfurled at her feet, she didn’t hesitate after five minutes to leave her to process it. "Sir Luke Strett is scheduled to see me at eleven, but I'm going out on purpose. Please tell him, in a misleading way, that I'm home, and you, as my stand-in, should see him instead. He'll prefer that this time. So please be nice to him." It required, of course, a more detailed explanation, especially mentioning that the visitor was a renowned doctor.

It functioned, in fact, much like Mrs. Lowder's had the previous night: it again made the atmosphere thick with enthusiastic agreement.

<div class="analysis-box">
<span class="box-label">Character Study</span>
<p>Based on the text, here is a concise character study:
</p><ul><li>*Milly Theale**</li>
Milly is presented as a young woman in a fragile, "menaced state of health," seeking refuge from an overwhelming "personal question." She enters the National Gallery wanting cultural immersion but feels too weak for it, identifying instead with the anonymous, absorbed lives of the copyists.<p>Her situation shifts abruptly when she encounters Merton Densher and Kate Croy. This shock forces her out of her passive retreat and into a calculated social performance. She adopts a spontaneous, vivacious "American girl" persona as a defense mechanism to control the awkwardness and, more importantly, to delay confronting the ominous news she intuits awaits her from Sir Luke Strett.
</p><li>*Kate Croy**</li>
Presented through Milly’s eyes, Kate is a socially masterful and "prodigious person." Her first appearance is in a potentially compromising situation with Merton Densher.<p>Her situation immediately shifts from private outing to public encounter, a change she manages instantly and without words. With a single "far smile," she takes control, making the awkward meeting seem natural. Later, she strategically removes herself to sit with Susie, an action Milly interprets as a calculated maneuver to manage Densher.
</p><li>*Merton Densher**</li>
He is first presented as an object of others' observation: a "handsome" gentleman, preoccupied and unaware he is being watched.<p>His situation shifts from private contemplation to a startling social encounter. His reaction is a "vivid blush," a mix of embarrassment and pleasure. He quickly follows Kate's and Milly's lead, moving from initial confusion to adopting a safe, talkative role, which Milly perceives as him falling in line with the conventionally "kind" way everyone treats her.
</p><li>*Susie Shepherd**</li></ul>
Susie is presented as the silent keeper of a looming reality. Milly observes a "feverish glitter" in her eyes, indicating she holds the report from Sir Luke Strett. Her situation has changed off-page, and she now embodies the unspoken tension that Milly is actively trying to escape.

<p>
The idea of the National Gallery had been with
her from the moment of her hearing from Sir Luke
Strett about his hour of coming. It had been in her
mind as a place so meagrely visited, as one of the
places that had seemed at home one of the attractions
of Europe and one of its highest aids to culture, but
that—the old story—the typical frivolous always
ended by sacrificing to vulgar pleasures. She had
had perfectly, at those whimsical moments on the
Brünig, the half-shamed sense of turning her back
on such opportunities for real improvement as had
figured to her, from of old, in connection with the
continental tour, under the general head of "pictures
and things"; and now she knew for what she had
done so. The plea had been explicit—she had done
so for life, as opposed to learning; the upshot of
which had been that life was now beautifully provided
for. In spite of those few dips and dashes
into the many-coloured stream of history for which
of late Kate Croy had helped her to find time, there
were possible great chances she had neglected, possible
great moments she should, save for to-day, have
all but missed. She might still, she had felt, overtake
one or two of them among the Titians and the
Turners; she had been honestly nursing the hour,
and, once she was in the benignant halls, her faith
knew itself justified. It was the air she wanted and
the world she would now exclusively choose; the
quiet chambers, nobly overwhelming, rich but slightly
veiled, opened out round her and made her presently
say "If I could lose myself <i>here!"</i> There
were people, people in plenty, but, admirably, no personal
question. It was immense, outside, the personal
question; but she had blissfully left it outside,
and the nearest it came, for a quarter of an hour,
to glimmering again into sight was when she
watched for a little one of the more earnest of the
lady-copyists. Two or three in particular, spectacled,
aproned, absorbed, engaged her sympathy to
an absurd extent, seemed to show her for the time
the right way to live. She should have been a lady copyist—it
met so the case. The case was the case
of escape, of living under water, of being at once
impersonal and firm. There it was before one—one
had only to stick and stick.
</p>
</div>
<details><summary>Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p><i>She'd been thinking about the National Gallery since Sir Luke Strett told her when he'd be arriving. She pictured it as a place that wasn't visited very often, even though it was one of those things that made Europe so appealing, one of its cultural high points. But, like always, people ended up choosing shallow fun over more meaningful pursuits. She'd felt ashamed of herself sometimes, like when she was on the Brünig, for turning away from the chance to improve herself, which she'd always associated with her European travels and "art and culture." Now she understood why she'd done it. The reason was clear—she'd chosen life over learning, and as a result, life was now comfortable and secure. Despite the few attempts she'd made recently, thanks to Kate Croy, to delve into the fascinating world of history, she'd missed out on some amazing experiences, some great moments that, except for today, she would have missed completely. She still hoped to catch up with some of them among the Titians and Turners. She'd been eagerly anticipating this visit, and now, in the welcoming galleries, she felt her expectations were justified. This was the atmosphere she craved, the world she wanted to be in: those calm, grand rooms, rich but slightly subdued, surrounded her and made her think, "If only I could just disappear here!" There were plenty of people, but thankfully, no personal drama. Outside, personal issues were everywhere, but she'd happily left them behind. The closest they came to resurfacing was when she watched a few of the more dedicated female copyists. She felt absurdly connected to a couple of them in particular, who were wearing glasses and aprons, and were completely focused on their work; for a little while, they seemed to show her the right way to live. She should have been a lady copyist—it suited her situation perfectly. Her situation was about escape, about living beneath the surface, about being both anonymous and resolute. The opportunity was right there—she just had to commit and persevere.</i></p></div>
</details>
</div><div class="section-block">
<div class="original-text">
<p>
Milly yielded to this charm till she was almost
ashamed; she watched the lady-copyists till she
found herself wondering what would be thought by
others of a young woman, of adequate aspect, who
should appear to regard them as the pride of the
place. She would have liked to talk to them, to get,
as it figured to her, into their lives, and was deterred
but by the fact that she didn't quite see herself as
purchasing imitations and yet feared she might excite
the expectation of purchase. She really knew
before long that what held her was the mere refuge,
that something within her was after all too weak
for the Turners and Titians. They joined hands
about her in a circle too vast, though a circle that a
year before she would only have desired to trace.
They were truly for the larger, not for the smaller
life, the life of which the actual pitch, for example,
was an interest, the interest of compassion, in misguided
efforts. She marked absurdly her little stations,
blinking, in her shrinkage of curiosity, at the
glorious walls, yet keeping an eye on vistas and approaches,
so that she shouldn't be flagrantly caught.
The vistas and approaches drew her in this way from
room to room, and she had been through many parts
of the show, as she supposed, when she sat down to
rest. There were chairs in scant clusters, places
from which one could gaze. Milly indeed at present
fixed her eyes more than elsewhere on the appearance,
first, that she couldn't quite, after all, have accounted
to an examiner for the order of her
"schools," and then on that of her being more tired
than she had meant, in spite of her having been so
much less intelligent. They found, her eyes, it
should be added, other occupation as well, which she
let them freely follow: they rested largely, in her
vagueness, on the vagueness of other visitors; they
attached themselves in especial, with mixed results,
to the surprising stream of her compatriots. She
was struck with the circumstance that the great
museum, early in August, was haunted with these
pilgrims, as also with that of her knowing them from
afar, marking them easily, each and all, and recognising
not less promptly that they had ever new
lights for her—new lights on their own darkness.
She gave herself up at last, and it was a consummation
like another: what she should have come to the
National Gallery for to-day would be to watch the
copyists and reckon the Baedekers. That perhaps
was the moral of a menaced state of health—that one
would sit in public places and count the Americans.
It passed the time in a manner; but it seemed already
the second line of defence, and this notwithstanding
the pattern, so unmistakable, of her country-folk.
They were cut out as by scissors, coloured, labelled,
mounted; but their relation to her failed to act—they
somehow did nothing for her. Partly, no
doubt, they didn't so much as notice or know her,
didn't even recognise their community of collapse
with her, the sign on her, as she sat there, that for
her too Europe was "tough." It came to her idly
thus—for her humour could still play—that she
didn't seem then the same success with them as with
the inhabitants of London, who had taken her up on
scarce more of an acquaintance. She could wonder
if they would be different should she go back with
that glamour attached; and she could also wonder,
if it came to that, whether she should ever go back.
Her friends straggled past, at any rate, in all the
vividness of their absent criticism, and she had even
at last the sense of taking a mean advantage.
There was a finer instant, however, at which three
ladies, clearly a mother and daughters, had paused
before her under compulsion of a comment apparently
just uttered by one of them and referring to
some object on the other side of the room. Milly
had her back to the object, but her face very much
to her young compatriot, the one who had spoken
and in whose look she perceived a certain gloom of
recognition. Recognition, for that matter, sat confessedly
in her own eyes: she <i>knew</i> the three, generically,
as easily as a schoolboy with a crib in his lap
would know the answer in class; she felt, like the
schoolboy, guilty enough—questioned, as honour
went, as to her right so to possess, to dispossess, people
who hadn't consciously provoked her. She
would have been able to say where they lived, and
how, had the place and the way been but amenable
to the positive; she bent tenderly, in imagination,
over marital, paternal Mr. Whatever-he-was, at
home, eternally named, with all the honours and
placidities, but eternally unseen and existing only
as some one who could be financially heard from.
The mother, the puffed and composed whiteness of
whose hair had no relation to her apparent age,
showed a countenance almost chemically clean and
dry; her companions wore an air of vague resentment
humanised by fatigue; and the three were
equally adorned with short cloaks of coloured cloth
surmounted by little tartan hoods. The tartans
were doubtless conceivable as different, but the
cloaks, curiously, only thinkable as one. "Handsome?
Well, if you choose to say so." It was the
mother who had spoken, who herself added, after a
pause during which Milly took the reference as to a
picture: "In the English style." The three pair
of eyes had converged, and their possessors had for
an instant rested, with the effect of a drop of the
subject, on this last characterisation—with that, too,
of a gloom not less mute in one of the daughters than
murmured in the other. Milly's heart went out to
them while they turned their backs; she said to herself
that they ought to have known her, that there
was something between them they might have beautifully
put together. But she had lost <i>them</i> also—they
were cold; they left her in her weak wonder
as to what they had been looking at. The "handsome"
disposed her to turn—all the more that the
"English style" would be the English school, which
she liked; only she saw, before moving, by the array
on the side facing her, that she was in fact among
small Dutch pictures. The action of this was again
appreciable—the dim surmise that it wouldn't then
be by a picture that the spring in the three ladies had
been pressed. It was at all events time she should
go, and she turned as she got on her feet. She had
had behind her one of the entrances and various visitors
who had come in while she sat, visitors single
and in pairs—by one of the former of whom she felt
her eyes suddenly held.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Milly was drawn to these artists, almost to the point of embarrassment. She watched the women copying the paintings and found herself wondering what people would think of a young woman who seemed to admire them so much. She wanted to talk to them, to understand their lives, but she hesitated because she didn't want to buy their imitations, fearing she might encourage them to expect a purchase. She soon realized that what was keeping her there was the simple comfort it offered. She felt too insecure for the great masters, like the Turners and Titians. These artists represented a world she couldn't fully access, a world that was too big for her. A year ago she would have longed to be part of that circle. They represented the larger, not the smaller life – a life in which the actual focus was compassion for misguided efforts. She was embarrassed by her small-mindedness, but kept glancing at the glorious paintings while keeping an eye out for interesting people, so she wouldn’t be caught gawking.</i></p><p><i>These people drew her from room to room. She had been through a good part of the museum before she sat down to rest. There were a few chairs grouped together, places where you could sit and look. Milly was particularly focused on two things: first, that she couldn't explain the order of the schools of art to an examiner; and second, that she was more tired than she had expected to be, despite not being as engaged with the art as she could have been.</i></p><p><i>She found herself, almost idly, observing the other visitors. She focused on the vague expressions of the other people, especially the surprisingly large number of her American compatriots. She was struck by how many tourists visited the museum in early August, and how easily she recognized them and realized they always offered her new perspectives – new insights into their own difficulties.</i></p><p><i>She finally gave in, and it felt like a final thing: that her purpose at the National Gallery that day was to watch the copyists and count the guidebooks. Perhaps that was the result of her poor health: she’d sit in public and count the Americans. It passed the time. But it felt like a second line of defense, despite the obvious stereotypes of her fellow countrymen. They were like cut-outs, color-coded and labeled, but she couldn't connect with them. They didn't seem to notice her or recognize that they were in the same predicament. Sitting there, she felt that for her too, Europe was "tough." It occurred to her, with a hint of humor, that she wasn't as successful with them as she was with the Londoners, who had welcomed her with little more than a casual acquaintance. She wondered if things would be different if she went back with some of that social prestige, and also wondered if she would ever go back.</i></p><p><i>Her friends, in all their absent criticism, drifted by. She felt that she was taking unfair advantage.</i></p><p><i>There was a better moment, when three women, clearly a mother and daughters, stopped in front of her. One of them had made a comment that they were discussing something on the other side of the room. Milly had her back to the object, but she watched her compatriot, the one who had spoken, and noticed a certain look of shared understanding in her eyes. Milly knew the three, generically, as a schoolboy knows the answer to a test. She felt guilty, wondering whether it was fair for her to judge people who hadn't consciously provoked her. She could have described where and how they lived, if only the situation would allow it. She imagined the husband, the father, at home, always being talked about but never seen, existing only as someone who could be counted on financially.</i></p><p><i>The mother, whose hair was perfectly white and meticulously styled, showed a blank expression. Her companions looked vaguely resentful but tired. They all wore short cloaks and tartan hoods. The tartans might have been different, but the cloaks were remarkably alike.</i></p><p><i>"Handsome? If you choose to say so," the mother said. After a pause, during which Milly assumed they were referring to a painting, the mother added, "In the English style." The three pairs of eyes had focused on this last comment and then, as if dismissing it, looked back at the painting, with the suggestion of gloom. Milly's heart went out to them. They were like cold strangers. She felt that they should have known her. She thought that they might have had something in common. But she had lost them. They left her wondering what they had been looking at.</i></p><p><i>The word "handsome" made her want to turn around – especially since "English style" meant the English school, which she liked. But before she could move, she saw the display on her side, and realized she was actually among small Dutch paintings. This made her wonder if the three women had been looking at a picture.</i></p><p><i>It was time to leave, and she turned as she stood up.

This was a gentleman in the middle of the place,
a gentleman who had removed his hat and was for a
moment, while he glanced, absently, as she could see,
at the top tier of the collection, tapping his forehead
with his pocket-handkerchief. The occupation held
him long enough to give Milly time to take for
granted—and a few seconds sufficed—that his face
was the object just observed by her friends. This
could only have been because she concurred in their
tribute, even qualified, and indeed "the English
style" of the gentleman—perhaps by instant contrast
to the American—was what had had the arresting
power. This arresting power, at the same time—and
that was the marvel—had already sharpened
almost to pain, for in the very act of judging the
bared head with detachment she felt herself shaken
by a knowledge of it. It was Merton Densher's
own, and he was standing there, standing long
enough unconscious for her to fix him and then hesitate.
These successions were swift, so that she
could still ask herself in freedom if she had best let
him see her. She could still reply to that that she
shouldn't like him to catch her in the effort to prevent
this; and she might further have decided that
he was too preoccupied to see anything had not a
perception intervened that surpassed the first in violence.
She was unable to think afterwards how long
she had looked at him before knowing herself as
otherwise looked at; all she was coherently to put together
was that she had had a second recognition
without his having noticed her. The source of this
latter shock was nobody less than Kate Croy—Kate
Croy who was suddenly also in the line of vision and
whose eyes met her eyes at their next movement.
Kate was but two yards off—Mr. Densher wasn't
alone. Kate's face specifically said so, for after a
stare as blank at first as Milly's it broke into a far
smile. That was what, wonderfully—in addition to
the marvel of their meeting—passed from her for
Milly; the instant reduction to easy terms of the fact
of their being there, the two young women, together.
It was perhaps only afterwards that the girl fully
felt the connection between this touch and her already
established conviction that Kate was a prodigious
person; yet on the spot she none the less, in a
degree, knew herself handled and again, as she had
been the night before, dealt with—absolutely even
dealt with for her greater pleasure. A minute in
fine hadn't elapsed before Kate had somehow made
her provisionally take everything as natural. The
provisional was just the charm—acquiring that character
from one moment to the other; it represented
happily so much that Kate would explain on the very
first chance. This left moreover—and that was the
greatest wonder—all due margin for amusement at
the way things happened, the monstrous oddity of
their turning up in such a place on the very heels of
their having separated without allusion to it. The
handsome girl was thus literally in control of the
scene by the time Merton Densher was ready to exclaim
with a high flush, or a vivid blush—one didn't
distinguish the embarrassment from the joy—"Why,
Miss Theale: fancy!" and "Why, Miss
Theale: what luck!"

Miss Theale had meanwhile the sense that for him
too, on Kate's part, something wonderful and unspoken
was determinant; and this although, distinctly,
his companion had no more looked at him with a
hint than he had looked at her with a question. He
had looked and he was looking only at Milly herself,
ever so pleasantly and considerately—she scarce
knew what to call it; but without prejudice to her
consciousness, all the same, that women got out of
predicaments better than men. The predicament of
course wasn't definite or phraseable—and the way
they let all phrasing pass was presently to recur to
our young woman as a characteristic triumph of the
civilised state; but she took it for granted, insistently,
with a small private flare of passion, because
the one thing she could think of to do for him was
to show him how she eased him off. She would
really, tired and nervous, have been much disconcerted,
were it not that the opportunity in question
had saved her. It was what had saved her most,
what had made her, after the first few seconds,
almost as brave for Kate as Kate was for her, had
made her only ask herself what their friend would
like of her. That he was at the end of three minutes,
without the least complicated reference, so
smoothly "their" friend was just the effect of their
all being sublimely civilised. The flash in which he
saw this was, for Milly, fairly inspiring—to that
degree in fact that she was even now, on such a
plane, yearning to be supreme. It took, no doubt,
a big dose of inspiration to treat as not funny—or
at least as not unpleasant—the anomaly, for Kate,
that <i>she</i> knew their gentleman, and for herself, that
Kate was spending the morning with him; but
everything continued to make for this after Milly
had tasted of her draught. She was to wonder in
subsequent reflection what in the world they had
actually said, since they had made such a success of
what they didn't say; the sweetness of the draught
for the time, at any rate, was to feel success assured.
What depended on this for Mr. Densher was all obscurity
to her, and she perhaps but invented the
image of his need as a short cut to service. Whatever
were the facts, their perfect manners, all round,
saw them through. The finest part of Milly's own
inspiration, it may further be mentioned, was the
quick perception that what would be of most service
was, so to speak, her own native wood-note. She
had long been conscious with shame for her thin
blood, or at least for her poor economy, of her unused
margin as an American girl—closely indeed as,
in English air, the text might appear to cover the
page. She still had reserves of spontaneity, if not
of comicality; so that all this cash in hand could now
find employment. She became as spontaneous as
possible and as American as it might conveniently
appeal to Mr. Densher, after his travels, to find her.
She said things in the air, and yet flattered herself
that she struck him as saying them not in the tone
of agitation but in the tone of New York. In the
tone of New York agitation was beautifully discounted,
and she had now a sufficient view of how
much it might accordingly help her.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Meanwhile, Miss Theale felt that something wonderful and unspoken, related to Kate, was also important to him. Even though, clearly, Kate hadn't given him any hints, just as he hadn't asked her any questions. He was only looking at Milly, very pleasantly and thoughtfully—she wasn't sure what to call it. But she still knew, despite that, that women were better at navigating tricky situations than men. The situation wasn't clear or easily described—and the way they avoided any explanation would later strike her as a characteristic success of polite society. She believed this intensely, with a private burst of feeling, because the only thing she could think to do for him was to show him how she could make things easier for him. She was tired and nervous, and would have been very upset, if this opportunity hadn't saved her. It had saved her, more than anything, making her, after the first few seconds, almost as brave for Kate as Kate was for her. It made her only wonder what their friend would want from her. The fact that he was, within three minutes, smoothly referred to as "their" friend, without any complications, was simply a result of them all being incredibly polite. The sudden realization of this was, for Milly, quite inspiring—so much so that she now, at that moment, wanted to be in control. It probably took a lot of inspiration to treat the fact that Kate knew their gentleman, and that Kate was spending the morning with him, as not funny—or at least, not unpleasant. But everything kept moving in this direction after Milly had taken her cue. She would later wonder what they had actually said, since they'd been so successful at what they hadn't said. For the time being, the positive outcome felt certain. What depended on this for Mr. Densher was completely unclear to her, and perhaps she just imagined his need as a quick way to be helpful. Whatever the facts, their perfect manners, all around, got them through. The best part of Milly's inspiration, it should be added, was the quick understanding that what would be most helpful was, so to speak, her own natural voice. She had long been ashamed of her perceived lack of depth, or at least her poor self-control, of her unused potential as an American girl—even though, in an English setting, it might seem like the rules covered everything. She still had reserves of spontaneity, if not of humor; so that this available resource could now be put to use. She became as spontaneous as possible and as American as she thought would appeal to Mr. Densher, after his travels. She made casual remarks, but she flattered herself that she sounded to him not agitated, but like someone from New York. In the tone of New York, anxiety was easily dismissed, and she now understood how much that could help her.</i></p></div>

The help was fairly rendered before they left the
place; when her friends presently accepted her invitation
to adjourn with her to luncheon at her hotel,
it was in the Fifth Avenue that the meal might have
waited. Kate had never been there so straight, but
Milly was at present taking her; and if Mr. Densher
had been he had at least never had to come so fast.
She proposed it as the natural thing—proposed it
as the American girl; and she saw herself quickly
justified by the pace at which she was followed.
The beauty of the case was that to do it all she had
only to appear to take Kate's hint. This had said,
in its fine first smile, "Oh yes, our look is queer—but
give me time;" and the American girl could give
time as nobody else could. What Milly thus gave
she therefore made them take—even if, as they
might surmise, it was rather more than they wanted.
In the porch of the museum she expressed her preference
for a four-wheeler; they would take their
course in that guise precisely to multiply the minutes.
She was more than ever justified by the positive
charm that her spirit imparted even to their use of
this conveyance; and she touched her highest point—that
is, certainly, for herself—as she ushered her
companions into the presence of Susie. Susie was
there with luncheon, with her return, in prospect;
and nothing could now have filled her own consciousness
more to the brim than to see this good friend
take in how little she was abjectly anxious. The
cup itself actually offered to this good friend might
in truth well be startling, for it was composed beyond
question of ingredients oddly mixed. She caught
Susie fairly looking at her as if to know whether
she had brought in guests to hear Sir Luke Strett's
report. Well, it was better her companion should
have too much than too little to wonder about; she
had come out "anyway," as they said at home, for
the interest of the thing; and interest truly sat in
her eyes. Milly was none the less, at the sharpest
crisis, a little sorry for her; she could of necessity
extract from the odd scene so comparatively little of
a soothing secret. She saw Mr. Densher suddenly
popping up, but she saw nothing else that had happened.
She saw in the same way her young friend
indifferent to her young friend's doom, and she
lacked what would explain it. The only thing to
keep her in patience was the way, after luncheon,
Kate almost, as might be said, made up to her. This
was actually perhaps as well what most kept Milly
herself in patience. It had in fact for our young
woman a positive beauty—was so marked as a deviation
from the handsome girl's previous courses.
Susie had been a bore to the handsome girl, and the
change was now suggestive. The two sat together,
after they had risen from table, in the apartment in
which they had lunched, making it thus easy for the
other guest and his entertainer to sit in the room adjacent.
This, for the latter personage, was the
beauty; it was almost, on Kate's part, like a prayer
to be relieved. If she honestly liked better to be
"thrown with" Susan Shepherd than with their
other friend, why that said practically everything.
It didn't perhaps altogether say why she had gone
out with him for the morning, but it said, as one
thought, about as much as she could say to his face.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>The help was provided before they left the museum. When her friends immediately accepted her invitation to go with her to lunch at her hotel, which was on Fifth Avenue, the meal was likely waiting for them. Kate had never been there so directly, but Milly was currently taking her. And if Mr. Densher had been, he had at least never had to rush so quickly. She suggested it as a natural thing—like the American girl that she was—and she quickly saw her decision validated by how quickly they followed her. The best part of it was that she only had to appear to be taking Kate's suggestion. Kate’s initial welcoming smile had said, "Yes, our situation is strange—but give me time"; and the American girl was patient in a way nobody else could be. Therefore, whatever Milly offered, she made them accept—even if they suspected they were getting more than they wanted. In the museum's entrance, she chose a horse-drawn carriage; they would use it to deliberately extend their time together. She was even more justified by the positive charm her spirit brought to their ride. And she reached her peak—at least, for herself—when she introduced her companions to Susie. Susie was there with lunch, with her return in mind; and nothing could have filled Milly's own thoughts more completely than seeing her good friend understand how little she was actually worried. The experience offered to this good friend might indeed be shocking, because it was made up of unusual and mixed elements. She noticed Susie looking at her, as if wondering if she had brought guests to hear Sir Luke Strett's report. Well, it was better that her friend should have too much rather than too little to wonder about. She had come out, “anyway,” as they said at home, for the excitement of it; and excitement was clear in her eyes. Milly was, nonetheless, at the most critical moment, a little sorry for her; she could get so little comfort or understanding from the strange scene. She saw Mr. Densher suddenly appear, but she saw nothing else that was happening. She also saw that her young friend was indifferent to her young friend's fate, and she couldn't understand it. The only thing that kept her patient was the way, after lunch, Kate almost made up to her. This was perhaps also what kept Milly herself patient. It actually had a beauty for our young woman—it was so clear as a change from the beautiful girl's previous behavior. Susie had been a nuisance to the beautiful girl, and the change was now meaningful. The two of them sat together, after they had finished eating, in the room where they had lunched, making it easy for the other guest and his host to sit in the next room. For Kate, this was the best part; it was almost like a plea for relief. If she honestly preferred spending time with Susan Shepherd rather than their other friend, that practically said everything. It didn't fully explain why she had gone out with him for the morning, but it said, as one might think, about as much as she could say to his face.</i></p></div>

Little by little indeed, under the vividness of
Kate's behaviour, the probabilities fell back into
their order. Merton Densher was in love, and Kate
couldn't help it—could only be sorry and kind:
wouldn't that, without wild flurries, cover everything?
Milly at all events tried it as a cover, tried
it hard, for the time; pulled it over her, in the front,
the larger room, drew it up to her chin with energy.
If it didn't, so treated, do everything for her, it did
so much that she could herself supply the rest. She
made that up by the interest of her great question,
the question of whether, seeing him once more, with
all that, as she called it to herself, had come and
gone, her impression of him would be different from
the impression received in New York. That had
held her from the moment of their leaving the
museum; it kept her company through their drive
and during luncheon; and now that she was a quarter
of an hour alone with him it became acute. She
was to feel at this crisis that no clear, no common
answer, no direct satisfaction on this point, was
to reach her; she was to see her question itself simply
go to pieces. She couldn't tell if he were different
or not, and she didn't know nor care if <i>she</i> were:
these things had ceased to matter in the light of the
only thing she did know. This was that she liked
him, as she put it to herself, as much as ever; and
if that were to amount to liking a new person the
amusement would be but the greater. She had
thought him at first very quiet, in spite of recovery
from his original confusion; though even the shade
of bewilderment, she yet perceived, had not been due
to such vagueness on the subject of her reintensified
identity as the probable sight, over there, of many
thousands of her kind would sufficiently have justified.
No, he was quiet, inevitably, for the first half
of the time, because Milly's own lively line—the line
of spontaneity—made everything else relative; and
because too, so far as Kate was spontaneous, it was
ever so finely in the air among them that the normal
pitch must be kept. Afterwards, when they had got
a little more used, as it were, to each other's separate
felicity, he had begun to talk more, clearly bethought
himself, at a given moment, of what <i>his</i> natural lively
line would be. It would be to take for granted
she must wish to hear of the States, and to give her,
in its order, everything he had seen and done there.
He abounded, of a sudden he almost insisted; he
returned, after breaks, to the charge; and the effect
was perhaps the more odd as he gave no clue whatever
to what he had admired, as he went, or to what
he hadn't. He simply drenched her with his sociable
story—especially during the time they were away
from the others. She had stopped then being American—all
to let him be English; a permission of
which he took, she could feel, both immense and unconscious
advantage. She had really never cared
less for the "States" than at this moment; but that
had nothing to do with the matter. It would have
been the occasion of her life to learn about them, for
nothing could put him off, and he ventured on no
reference to what had happened for herself. It
might have been almost as if he had known that the
greatest of all these adventures was her doing just
what she did then.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>Gradually, as Kate's behavior became more obvious, the situation unfolded as expected. Merton Densher was in love, and Kate couldn't prevent it—she could only be regretful and kind. Wouldn't that, without causing a scene, resolve everything? At any rate, Milly tried to use that as a cover, tried hard to accept it for the time being. She embraced it, both literally and figuratively. She found comfort in it. If it didn't solve everything, it did so much that she could fill in the gaps herself. She did this by focusing on her central question: whether, seeing him again, considering everything that had happened, her opinion of him would be different from the impression she'd had in New York. That thought had occupied her from the moment they left the museum. It stayed with her during their drive and lunch. Now that she was alone with him for fifteen minutes, the question became intense. At this moment, she felt she wouldn't get a clear, straightforward answer, or any direct satisfaction. Her question itself seemed to be crumbling. She couldn't tell if he was different or not, and she didn't know or care if she herself was. These things were no longer important, because she knew only one thing: she liked him, as much as ever. If that meant she was liking a new person, it would only make it more interesting. She had initially thought him very reserved, even though he had recovered from his initial confusion. She realized that his slight bewilderment hadn't been caused by the idea of her returning, even though the sight of thousands of similar women would probably have justified it. No, he was quiet, inevitably, at first, because Milly's own outgoing personality made everything else seem less significant. Also, as far as Kate was spontaneous, it was always implied between them that they had to maintain a certain level of decorum. Later, when they had gotten a little more comfortable with each other's happiness, he began to talk more, clearly deciding, at a given moment, what his natural and lively conversation style would be. He would assume she wanted to hear about America and would tell her, in order, everything he had seen and done there. He suddenly talked a lot, even insisted at times. He kept returning to the subject after pauses. This was perhaps even stranger because he never gave any hint of what he had liked or disliked while he was there. He simply bombarded her with his social stories, especially when they were away from the others. She stopped being American then—all to let him be English. She could feel that he took both enormous and unconscious advantage of this. She had never cared less about "America" than at that moment, but that wasn't the point. It would have been the perfect opportunity to learn about it, because nothing could stop him from talking, and he never mentioned what had happened to her. It was almost as if he knew that the greatest adventure of all was her doing exactly what she was doing then.</i></p></div>

It was at this point that she saw the smash of her
great question as complete, saw that all she had to
do with was the sense of being there with him. And
there was no chill for this in what she also presently
saw—that, however he had begun, he was now acting
from a particular desire, determined either by
new facts or new fancies, to be like everyone else,
simplifyingly "kind" to her. He had caught on
already as to manner—fallen into line with everyone
else; and if his spirits verily <i>had</i> gone up it might
well be that he had thus felt himself lighting on the
remedy for all awkwardness. Whatever he did or
he didn't, Milly knew she should still like him—there
was no alternative to that; but her heart could none
the less sink a little on feeling how much his view
of her was destined to have in common with—as she
now sighed over it—<i>the</i> view. She could have
dreamed of his not having <i>the</i> view, of his having
something or other, if need be quite viewless, of his
own; but he might have what he could with least
trouble, and <i>the</i> view wouldn't be, after all, a positive
bar to her seeing him. The defect of it in general—if
she might so ungraciously criticise—was that, by
its sweet universality, it made relations rather prosaically
a matter of course. It anticipated and superseded
the—likewise sweet—operation of real
affinities. It was this that was doubtless marked in
her power to keep him now—this and her glassy lustre
of attention to his pleasantness about the scenery
in the Rockies. She was in truth a little measuring
her success in detaining him by Kate's success in
"standing" Susan. It would not be, if she could
help it, Mr. Densher who should first break down.
Such at least was one of the forms of the girl's inward
tension; but beneath even this deep reason was
a motive still finer. What she had left at home on
going out to give it a chance was meanwhile still,
was more sharply and actively, there. What had
been at the top of her mind about it and then been
violently pushed down—this quantity was again
working up. As soon as their friends should go
Susie would break out, and what she would break
out upon wouldn't be—interested in that gentleman
as she had more than once shown herself—the personal
fact of Mr. Densher. Milly had found in her
face at luncheon a feverish glitter, and it told what
she was full of. She didn't care now for Mr. Densher's
personal fact. Mr. Densher had risen before
her only to find his proper place in her imagination
already, of a sudden, occupied. His personal fact
failed, so far as she was concerned, to be personal,
and her companion noted the failure. This could
only mean that she was full to the brim, of Sir Luke
Strett, and of what she had had from him. What
<i>had</i> she had from him? It was indeed now working
upward again that Milly would do well to know,
though knowledge looked stiff in the light of Susie's
glitter. It was therefore, on the whole, because
Densher's young hostess was divided from it by so
thin a partition that she continued to cling to the
Rockies.

<div class="translation-content"><p><i>That’s when she understood the full impact of her big question. She realized the only thing she needed to focus on was the feeling of being with him. And there was no disappointment in what she also realized: regardless of how he’d started, he was now acting out of a specific desire, possibly driven by new information or new fantasies, to be like everyone else, and be simplistically "kind" to her. He’d already learned how to behave, fitting in with everyone else; and if his mood had genuinely improved, it could very well be that he thought he’d found the solution to any awkwardness. Whatever he did or didn’t do, Milly knew she would still like him – there was no other choice; but her heart still sank a little when she felt how much his perception of her would align with—as she now sighed over—the prevailing view. She could have hoped he wouldn't have that view, that he’d have something unique of his own, even if it wasn't a view at all. But he might as well take the path of least resistance, and the view wouldn't entirely prevent her from seeing him. The flaw in the general situation - if she could be so critical – was that its sweet universality made their relationship rather ordinary. It pre-empted and replaced the—equally nice—workings of genuine connection. That was undoubtedly the factor in her ability to keep him there now, along with her perfectly attentive focus on his pleasant comments about the scenery in the Rockies. She was, in truth, subtly measuring her success in keeping him by Kate’s success in “handling” Susan. It wouldn’t be, if she could help it, Mr. Densher who would be the first to leave. This was at least one of the ways the girl was feeling the pressure internally; but beneath this more obvious reason was a more nuanced motivation. What she had left at home when she had gone out to give it a chance, was still there, and now more intensely present. The thing she'd been thinking most about, that she’d then pushed down, was now rising back up. As soon as their friends left, Susie would explode, and what she would explode about wouldn’t be – despite having shown interest in the man more than once – the personal fact of Mr. Densher. Milly had seen a feverish excitement in her face at lunch, and it revealed what she was preoccupied with. She didn’t care now about Mr. Densher’s personal reality. Mr. Densher had appeared before her only to find his proper place in her imagination already, suddenly, occupied. His personal reality, as far as she was concerned, had become irrelevant, and her companion noticed the irrelevance. This could only mean that she was overflowing with thoughts of Sir Luke Strett, and what she’d gotten from him. What had she gotten from him? It was now beginning to dawn on Milly that it would be wise to know, though knowledge felt rigid in the face of Susie’s excitement. Therefore, all things considered, because Densher’s young hostess was separated from the truth by only a thin barrier, she continued to cling to the Rockies.</i></p></div>
